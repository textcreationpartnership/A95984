            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN firſt I attended your Lordſhip, about preparing of an <hi>Act, against the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting of Gold,</hi> your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was pleaſed to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of mee; and that you had heard of my Impriſonment in the Tower, you comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mee to uſe my uttermoſt endeavors, to ſerv the Common-wealth, that ſo I might give a clear teſtimonie both to your Lordſhip and the State, of my good affection to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government; and by that means, the State might bee induced to conſider my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that my buſineſs might bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Parlament, and I have Juſtice, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring mee to my Eſtate again.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:119441:3"/>
                  <p>In humble purſuance of your Honor's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I did print ſeveral Placarts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the regulating of their Monie, Bullion, and Mints, and breviated the Laws and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations heretofore made in <hi>England</hi> againſt Tranſporting of Treaſure. And made ſeveral arguments upon the whole matter, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it did concern this Common-wealth, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give a ſtop to the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver, and ſeveral other abuſes practiſed upon the Coin and Bullion of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And I did humbly preſent one of the Books to your Honor, and had your Honor's approbation for the ſpeedie paſsing of the Act, which your Honor, and the Right Honorable the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> had recommended to the Parlament; but as yet, through the induſtrie of ſom guiltie men, this Law, which ſo highly concern's the ſafetie, and welfare of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not paſſed the Parlament. And if it were diſpatched, it would reſtore your Mint, to <hi>it's flouriſhing condition, by removing all obſtructions in the Mint.</hi> And then the ſettling the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Coins in Chriſtendom, and the Parr of the Exchange, between us and them, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of Chriſtendom, I would ſee ſhould bee finiſhed, and the myſteries of Exchange opened, to the high advantage of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb facs="tcp:119441:3"/> of this Nation, who are now generally ignorant of this myſterie, and are as far to ſeek of theſe Sciences, as two hundred year ago, the paſſage to the Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> was to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The reaſon is, in <hi>England</hi> wee have none but our own Monie run's in currant paiment, &amp; our Merchants are generally ignorant of the true value and fineneſs of Forrain Coins, and what proportion all Forrain Coins hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them, and the juſt weights and fineneſs all Forrain Coins ought to hold, and beeing all weightie according to their juſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, what they will make the Merchant to coin them into our Monie within the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> and this is the Parr I humbly intend, and petition your Honor for the ſpeedie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Theſe things are no ſecrets to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, and other Merchant-Strangers here, and that make's them ſo out-wit the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of our Nation, upon the Exchanges of Monie to any part of Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>My Lord! I humbly again addreſs my ſelf to your Lordſhip, with ſom prime Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Trade, which may highly concern the Common-wealth; and it hath been no ſmall comfort to mee, that both your Honor, and many other Honorable Gentlemen of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> upon the reading of them in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, do approv of what I have don in this particular, and that you will ſpeedily put
<pb facs="tcp:119441:4"/> it in practice for the good of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>My Lord! I have obeyed your commands for the putting in an <hi>Index</hi> to what I have ſaid, that ſo you may contract what is by mee humbly deſired. <hi>The whole drift of what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, is the equal inriching of the Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the repairing and inhabiting all our Sea-Port-Towns, and Harbors, the bringing in a Nurſerie of rich Merchants into our Land, the increaſ of Manufacturie, the increaſ of Shipping, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all our poor awork, the making</hi> England <hi>the Mistreſs and Emproſs of the Sea, in beeing a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark and Protection to her Friends, by ſpreading out her arms to give ſhelter in all weathers, both for Merchant-men, and Men of War,</hi> in all her Havens and Harbors, both to ſhelter them from ſtorms, and to furniſh them with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ammunition, Victuals and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, for all parts of the world, and to bee the Magazin for the world, for all wealth and Trade. For as the World is Ring, ſo <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the Diamond of that Ring; and the wealth, ſtrength, and valor of this Nation, was never ſo well known to all our neighbors, as under the government of a Common-wealth, as it is now ſettled, and a few years will ſhew to the world. This I ſay to bee true, ſo viſibly, that the pooreſt Commoner in this Nation, will finde there is as much difference between the ſituation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to bring
<pb facs="tcp:119441:4"/> and contract the Trade of the world, as there is in proportion, difference between an ounce Troie, and a pound weight Troie; for they in <hi>Holland,</hi> have not ſix points of the Compaſs, to have winde to go in and out, and all dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seas, and in ſom of them, as at the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, fortie ſail of ſhips are caſt away in a year. <hi>But behold,</hi> England <hi>hang's in the Sea, like an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental Pearl at a fair Ladie's ear, no winde can blow at any point of the Compaſs, but ſhips may both go in and com out of her Harbors.</hi> And I believ, a <hi>Free Trade</hi> will treble the Importation, and Exportation of goods into all the Sea-Ports of this Nation, beſides the emploiment of the ſhipping of the Nation. <hi>And as wee are a ſhield and protection to our friends,</hi> by putting in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution theſe Obſervations, you will reduce the rebellious Sea-men of our own Nation, have an accompt of their wives and children, in what ſervice they are, and where againſt the State; and by this means, if not out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and love to the preſent Government, yet out of an affection to their wives and children, and to ſave their eſtates, you ſhall have them return to their obedience; for when their wives are ſequeſtred in <hi>England,</hi> it will bee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Load-ſtone, then your Men of War you ſend out, to reduce them, and this buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire's a diligent and able man, to give the State an Accompt from time to time, and if it
<pb facs="tcp:119441:5"/> bee effectually followed, will bring home moſt of our Sea-men to their obedience, a buſineſs of the higheſt conſequence both to reduce them, with the leaſt change of bloud and monie.</p>
                  <p>Then the examination of the carriage of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies, for the private enriching of a few, is humbly preſented to the Council of State, and the Council for Trade, that ſo the abuſes for the times paſt, may bee found out and puniſhed, and ſuch Rules and Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the future, may bee made as ſhall bee moſt conducing to the benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in general, without any private regard to private perſons. My Lord! this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which I have undertaken, concern's the corrupt intereſt of many men, who will ſtorm to ſee theſe things laid open to the world, and I ſhall bee ſure to bee ſtung with the venom of ſom of their tongues; Therefore I am an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuitor to your Honor and the Council of State, for your Honor's protection and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of theſe my weak endevors for the ſervice of this Nation, which noble favor ſhall for ever oblige mee to praie for your Honor's happineſs and proſperitie.

Indeed, many of them were drawn by mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five years ago in the Tower, afore I ever thought of a Council of Trade. But ſeeing it is the hap of theſe unpoliſhed Papers to bee recommended to your care, I am verie glad of it, and moſt humbly give the Council of State thanks for recommending them to your judicious examination; making no queſtion of their ſowing in a fertile ground, ſeeing ſom of theſe Propoſitions are already com to the perfections of Acts of Parlament. May it
<pb facs="tcp:119441:6"/> pleaſ your Honors, I am no other then the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboring man; I have brought you Marble from the Mine, felled you Trees, and brought them to you, and at your feet laie them all, to bee hewn and ſquared by your judicious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Wiſdoms; You are the Maſter-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are now to take your Inſtruments to hew &amp; ſquare them for the building of the trade of this Common-wealth. And I ſhall preſume to wait on you thoſe daies you ſit, to ſee how your Building goe's forward; and when that you give a diſpatch of the Materials in theſe Propoſitions, it ſhall not repent mee of what I have don. And I ſhall with all humilitie and chearfulneſs furniſh you with ſom other Propoſitions for the ſervice of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To ſo great and grave Judgments, I know multiplicitie of words need not; the great God of Heaven and Earth bee in the midſt of your Counſels, and bee Counſellor to you all, and put that into your hearts, that you may bee enabled for ſo great a work, as the State hath laid on you, and to bee careful of the maintenance of the Trade that concern's the poor of this Nation in general, that they may have a livelihood as well as the rich. And thus much in all humilitie, let mee tell you, if ever any men in this Nation had need to make uſe of Chriſt's rule, <hi>of beeing as innocent as Doves
<pb facs="tcp:119441:6"/> and as wiſe as Serpents,</hi> it is your Honors in this emploiment you have for regulating of Trade. The infinite ſubtilties, frauds and abuſes in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Trades, are ſo many, that the hundredth part of the cheats uſed to get monie, cannot bee imagined by any other perſons but your ſelvs, that daily hear the abuſes practiſed on many Manufactures made in this Nation. And ſom men by theſe cheats, have gotten wealth and dignitie; for in <hi>London</hi> formerly, many times they choſe Aldermen moſt an end for their wealth, not for their wit or honeſtie, and that hath made ſuch a hole in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London's</hi> Treaſure, &amp; the poor Orphans portions, when ſuch Kites as got their Eſtates indirectly came to bee Magiſtrates. Other Trades there are, whoſe povertie beeing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with more multitudes in the Trade then it will bear, make's many people in ſeveral Trades, fall a making the Manufacture indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, falſly, and ſlightly, to the great abuſe of the Nation, and all the wearers; and this more particularly I know is don, in the making of Gold and Silver-Thread, as was juſtified to your Honors by hundreds of the women-ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>London,</hi> upon their Petition againſt the Wheel-ſpinners, and their humble deſires to your Honors for a Regulation for the future: So that what between the covetouſneſs of the
<pb facs="tcp:119441:7"/> rich, and the neceſsitie of the poor, all the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Trade is committed; and theſe weeds will everie daie increaſ in the Garden of this Common-wealth, if the Parlament make not ſtrict and ſharp Laws againſt theſe offences, and offendors, that make the Manufactures of the Nation ſlight and baſe. And not onely to make Laws, but appoint ſuch perſons as ſhall ſee thoſe Laws put in execution, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice bee don; and theſe men would bee the pruning knives to rectifie the Garden of Trade: and till it bee don, the abuſes in Trade and Manufacture will not bee prevented. I have humbly and plainly told you what I think is to bee don for the beſt improvement of the Trade of this Nation, and leav what I have ſaid to your Honor's grave conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſhall ever praie for the proſperitie of your Honors:</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any of theſe Papers were drawn by mee in my ſolitude in the Tower, and I never intended them for publick view, but for my private uſe; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Providence ordering it ſo, I was commanded by ſom of the Council of State to give them my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and humble advice about removing the obſtruction of the Mint, and to attend ſom honorable Gentlemen, who were to draw a table of the just value of all the Coins in Chriſtendom, and to ſettle their true values according to the Standard of the Mint in the Tower of London, and what thoſe Coins will make in our Mint beeing full weight; a great part of that work is already don, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del drawn for the taking away the obſtructions of the Mint in the Tower of London, and when the
<pb facs="tcp:119441:8"/> Parlament and Council of State pleaſ to command, it will bee perfectly finiſhed; having this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with ſomof the Council of State, I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſom of them to draw them ſuch Obſervations concerning Trade, as I did conceiv might bee for the benefit of the Common-wealth, the increaſ of Trade, and the increaſ of Shipping. And though I knew my own inſufficiencie for ſo weightie a buſineſs, and that there were many hundred in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don more able to do this then my ſelf; yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that now God had put into my hands an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie that I might preſent my ſelf to the Council of State, and to the Nation in general, that I was not ſuch a man as ſom maliciouſly had charged mee to bee, which was, that I was a Malignant, and one diſ-affected to the preſent Government, as it is now ſettled, without King and Lords. I ſaie, to give a clear teſtimonie of the falſneſs of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious charge against mee, I was willing to obey the commands of ſom of the Council of State, and did with all humilitie preſent to my Lord Preſident and ſom of the Council of State, moſt of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, for their private uſe, and they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably pleaſed to accept of my endeavors, and gave mee their approbation of them, as a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice offered by mee to the Common-wealth, wherein I did deſerv all encouragement, and that the State would ſee to put many of them in execution; which noble favor of theirs, far beyond my imagination
<pb facs="tcp:119441:8"/> and deſert, hath everlastingly obliged mee to their ſervice, to ſtudie alwaies to advance the intereſt and proſperitie of the preſent Government of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as it is now ſettled, without King or Lords, to the uttermoſt of my power, and to the last drop of bloud I have, againſt any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whomſoëver, that endeavor the damage or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of the preſent Government.</p>
                  <p>Now my request is to all the worthie Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of this Nation, that ſom of them would bee pleaſed to take this argument into their hands, and what I have ſaid undigeſtedly, and without a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, they with a more learned pen would perfect for the ſervice of the Nation in general. Moſt of theſe Papers are tranſmitted down to the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Council of Trade, by an order of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, and referred to their judicious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And the true reaſon of my printing of them is, that ſom more learned pen might finiſh what I have roughly begun; and whoſoëver doth it, would do a great ſervice to the Common-wealth. And for the Merchant-strangers that live and inhabit in any part of this Nation, my requeſt to them all is, That they would conſider of what I have here preſented in their behalfs, and that they would all contribute their advice and reaſons for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is by mee humbly propounded, and ſo to carrie themſelvs in all their actions, that no just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions may bee laid to their charge of beeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb facs="tcp:119441:9"/> Instruments either to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that any of their dealings ſhould bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to the proſperitie and commerce of this Nation; but that they in humble requital of the Parlament's Protection, which they all enjoie equally with the Natives of this Nation, would bee pleaſed to studie all waies and means for the ſetting of ſuch Manufactures here, as they know is made beyond Seas, for employing our ſhipping, for contributing their humble advice in repairing our Havens and Harbors, for dreining of our Lands, for employing of our poor, for ſetting up the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade, for making our Sea-Port-Towns their ſtore-houſes of Corn, and for laying a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bringing in their rich commodities from all parts of the world into our Ports and Harbors of England, wee having far better and ſecurer Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors then our Neighbors. And for their enabling them to do this, that they would humbly propound to the Parlament and Council of Trade, the best means and waies they conceiv all theſe things may don; whereof one of the principal waies is, to have free Ports in this Nation, to Import and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport all Forrain goods Cuſtom-free, that is not ſpent in this Nation; and for their ſettling of a bank in London, and ſettling of a courſ of Bils of Exchange in ſeveral Sea-Port-Towns of this Nation; and for the ſettling of a Court of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in London, to determine all differences
<pb facs="tcp:119441:9"/> amongſt Merchants. If they would ſtudie theſe things, and all others they know, which would conduce to the profit and honor of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and would ſhew themſelves openly that they are publick ſpirited men, they would Petition the Parlament, and Council of Trade, in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and when they are required by thoſe in Autoritie, would contribute their beſt reaſons and advices clearly, without any by-ends, juſtly, and according to the great experience many of them have by their knowledg of buſineſs of trade in other Countries. This would bee a great ſervice to the Nation in general, and it is no more then I think is their dutie to do, and I humbly conceiv the State exſpect's from them, they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>And that all Merchants would preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the State, what new Cuſtoms and Imposts have been laid on the Engliſh Nation in Forrain parts, more then was formerly laid; that ſo, if our Merchants cannot procure a redreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs beyond ſeas, the State; upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Petition, might by their Letters or other waies, to Forrain States, take notice of it, and ſee our Merchants to have right; and this is uſual in <hi>Holland,</hi> upon the leaſt obstruction of trade, or intrenching upon the Merchants; the States General make it matter of ſtate, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force or by treatie, remove the obſtruction, as all men know, that are acquainted with their
<pb facs="tcp:119441:10"/> proceedings between the King of Denmark and them, for Customs in the Sound, and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals and them in the East and West-Indies, and in their other tranſactions with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States; their principal care is, to take off the obſtructions of Trade, I praie God all just and fair-dealing Merchants with us, may have the like and greater countenance and protection from the State, then their Merchants have in Holland. And whereas the Merchant-stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in London, have exacted on them ſeveral fees more then is conceived to bee by Law, that theſe Merchant-ſtrangers would petition the State, that the Citie of London bee required to bring in forthwith the tables of fees for Package, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, and all other duties they can by Law juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and anciently demand of the Merchant-ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And that a certain rule may bee ſet up up in Printed tables in the Cuſtom-Houſes, what fees ſhall bee taken for the future. And that ſuch Officers that have formerly exacted more monie of the Merchants, then their juſt fees, may bee compelled to reſtore the monie back to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. And if the State reliev Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangers here, it will bee a great Load-stone to other States and Nations to do all right to our Merchants beyond Seas.</p>
                  <p>But for thoſe men, either Engliſh or stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, (I will not honor them with the name of
<pb facs="tcp:119441:10"/> Merchants) that are Tranſporters of Wool, Fuller's Earth, Horſes, Gold and Silver, or any other prohibited goods, to the weakning and impoveriſhing of this Nation; and all ſuch as have culled and melted down the heavie Monie of this Nation into Ingots, and ſold it to ſuch as have Tranſported it, or to ſuch as have made Gold and ſilver Wier, and ſilver Thread, and ſuch as have couzened the Common-wealth by buying up the light and clipped Engliſh ſilver Coin, and vented it again to Graziers or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Caſhiers, or any other perſons, to the great deceit and damage of the Common-wealth; I ſhall leav them all to the Law, with this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento to them, That as Justice is leaden-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſhee hath iron hands; and though ſlow, yet ſhee is ſure, and all ages have held men that do theſe things, as Moths and Cankers in a Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>But for your juſt Merchant, hec is the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Ornament of the Common-wealth, a great pillar in any Nation where they remain; and that State or Common-wealth that doth not love and protect them, muſt at long running bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to povertie. For mee to ſpeak of the worth and dignitie of fair-dealing-Merchants in all ages, is to hold a Candle to the Sun; onely my praier to God ſhall bee, that their numbers may bee encreaſed in this Nation, and all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:119441:11"/> given them by the State, that they may have good Convoie to guard their ſhips, both outwards and inwards, from Pirats and Rovers; and if it bee the chance of any Merchant-men to meet with Pirats, that God would ſtrengthen their ſea-men, and give them valiant and loial hearts to fight for their Countrie, and their Merchant's ſhips and goods; and after their deliverance from Pirats, God's protection go along with them all, and bring them everie one to his deſired Port; and at the end of our daies, bring us all to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Harbor of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this ſhall bee the praier of</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Everal Reaſons for the admitting all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to have equal privileges, ſo far as agreeth with the Pattern and Policie of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Legorn,</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> who have gotten themſelvs to the hight &amp; greatneſs of trade; And therefore hold in all Common-wealths that are ſeated, (as by the bleſsing of God this is one) in the midſt of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119441:12"/> the Seas, beeing adorned and beautified with more ſafe and fair Harbors for ſhipping, then any of our Neighbors whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And there ought to bee an eſpecial eie had upon the paths and ſteps of our neighbors, to ſee by what waies and means they have got to this greatneſs of Trade, and to keep a good obſervation of theſe times; and to give all encouragement to the Dutch and Forain Nations to com and plant in our Ports and Harbors; They having many of them an earneſt deſire not to bee ſo penned up as they are, and therefore many Families are lately removed to <hi>Breme,</hi> and <hi>Hambrough,</hi> out of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As was preſented to the Council of Trade, by a worthy Member of the Council of State, with his Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Council of Trade, to take all Informaltions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning free Ports, or Landing places for Forain commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Imported, without paying of Cuſtom if again exported, &amp; in what manner the ſame is beſt to bee effected; in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof, &amp; for the advance of Trade, I have, according to directions of ſom of the Council of State, treated with the principal Merchants in this Citie; and I do humbly preſent theſe few Heads unto your Honors conſideration, for the benefit of Trade, and the Nation in General.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Genoa, Legorn</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> have raiſed their greatneſs onely by giving Merchants Strangers, equal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges with their Natives, and in levying Imal duties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goods;</p>
                  <p>And if not ſpent in their Ports, freely to export them to any part of the world, by which means they have been made the Ware-houſes and Shops for all the Merchandizes in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the ſame means alſo they grow <hi>in Amſterdam mightie in Shipping and Sea-men; for they know the benefit that onely the bringing of goods thither, though never ſpent in the Countrie, make's them; for there is not the thouſand part of the goods ſpent in</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam <hi>that is brought thither, but ſhipped again all over the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119441:12"/>
                  <p>And they have this advantage, that all the Commodities of the world are there to bee had, which is a benefit to them that ſpend the Commodities, to have the Market at their own doors, for they can have it cheaper, then to go abroad for it.</p>
                  <p>And the wealth that is gotten by Shipping, Ware-houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, and imploiment of thouſands of laboring people, in lading and unlading Merchandize, is and hath been one of the faireſt flowers in the Garland of <hi>Amſterdam, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Legorn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by the bleſsing of God, and the Parlaments counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch Merchants and others, that ſhall put to their helping hands, and their induſtries, the Sea-Ports of this Nation will participate in a large proportion with them, and put the inhabitants of our Sea-Ports in a flouriſhing condition; wee may ſee it by experience when our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition Trade was at <hi>Dover,</hi> what that Town made the State a year for half Cuſtoms, and how the rents of houſes were raiſed, how all the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men grew rich, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſet the poor awork; and alſo the great imploiment of our Shipping and Navigation, and no Town in <hi>England</hi> lived more happily, (make it but a free Port, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it again to its former condition) whereas now their poor do ſo infinitely increaſ on them, that many periſh for want of means, and all the houſes in the Town not worth the third penny rent they were ten yeers ago; for at the time the Cuſtoms made fifty thouſand pounds every year, now not four thouſand pound <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I pray your Honors obſerv where great Cuſtoms are laid, there, either in Kingdom or Common-wealth, the Trade decayeth, and at laſt fal's to nothing; 'tis true they may bee preſent benefits, and have been made uſe of by evil Councellors, both in this Age and formerly, both in this Nation and others; But I pray obſerv thoſe remedies have ever been worſ then the diſeaſes, and in ſom places it hath coſt ſom of the Inventors, their lives, others, their eſtates, and all of them, at long running, repentance; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119441:13"/> thoſe Kingdoms, Nations, or Common-wealths, that have ſooneſt recovered out of them, have been the eaſieſt cure of their diſtempers and commotions.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in ſuch Kingdoms, Nations, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, where ſuch oppreſsions have long continued, when the remedie com's to bee workt and wrought, it work's ſo violently as it break's all the old frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in pieces, or elſ weaken's it in that manner that it corn's not to its firſt ſtrength again in ſom Ages; and this I humbly conceiv is like ſhortly to bee the fate of a great Kingdom, I mean <hi>France;</hi> The inventions for gathering money there beeing ſo many that the common people their life is bitter to them, and in all likelihood will end in the ruine of their Task-maſters: for the furie of an oppreſſed people, and a breach of an inraged ſea is one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All men know <hi>Spain</hi> was the Fountain of Gold and Silver, while Cuſtoms were eaſie, the Fleets returning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year with <hi>fifteen, and ſixteen Millions regiſtred, and all the rich commodities brought out of the Indies, landed in</hi> Spain, when there was a ſmal Cuſtom. Afterwards by ill counſel, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Silver and Commodities was raiſed from two, and three in the hundred, to five, ſix, eight, ten, twelv, fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> and more for commodities, which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſeeing, and finding no remedie, grew diſcontent; and caſting about which way to avoid this dutie, agreed that Ships ſhould lie out beyond the <hi>Bay</hi> of Saint <hi>Lucar, Cales, and other Roads, when the</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Ships came home;</hi> and there take out their Silver and rich Commodities, and ſhip it for other parts of the world, before it paid one pennie Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, or touched the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhore. <hi>Behold what the State got by this, they might have had all the returns landed in the Kingdom of</hi> Spain, <hi>had they been content with moderate Cuſtoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And not beeing content with it, the greateſt of what com's from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is ſent away as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and <hi>Spain,</hi> that is, according to a wel-regulated Trade, the Fountain of Gold and Silver, is filled onely with black money, copper money, going at ten times the true value, it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119441:13"/> it will make in any part of Chriſtendom; The Merchants Caſh-houſes beeing more like Braziers ſhops, then banks of Treaſure, and the proverb is fulfilled, which ſaith, who goe's worſ ſhod then the ſhoo-maker's wife. So in <hi>Spain</hi> that ſhould abound in ſilver, there is nothing ſtirring in paiment there, within two months after the Fleet com's in from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> but black monie. <hi>And now the miſchief is past cure, Forain Nations having filled them with ſuch quantities of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per monie, that it cannot bee called in; I pray God that the State would keep an eie of our Coins, and keep that little wee have now left in the Nation, and call the tranſporters of Gold and Silver to a ſtrict accompt, or elſ this Nation will finde the inconveniencie when it is too late.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If you will have Trade flouriſh, give the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Merchants Strangers here, as they have in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and other parts of Chriſtendom; they have found that courſ to bee thriving to them for many years, and themſelvs and the ſtrangers that have planted amongſt them to bee both equally advantaged by it. And in <hi>France, Spain, Legorn, Genoa, Poland, and many other places, where all ſtrangers of what Nation ſoëver, paie no more Cuſtom then the Natives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs; and this buſineſs had not been now to do, had it not been for the old Farmors in the Cuſtom-Houſ. About fourteen years ago I was emploied by the late King to have ſettled it,</hi> (when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſilver to bee brought up to bee coined from <hi>Dover,</hi> was concluded of) But I found my <hi>Lord Cottington, and the old Farmors againſt free Ports,</hi> out of an opinion that <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> ever had to bee averſ againſt any model of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it ſavoring of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> too much, and not beeing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his deſigns, which was alwaies for <hi>Monarchie,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> greatneſs. The old Farmors I do verily believ were not againſt it out of any averſneſs, or envie to the wealth of this Nation's increaſ by a free Trade, but for ſom other reaſons, and ſom as I am confident were that upon letting in of a free Trade, you would draw a great many Merchants Strangers in here, which are very prying and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119441:14"/> men, men acquainted with managing the Exciſe and Cuſtoms in <hi>Holland,</hi> and they would preſently diſcover that which they (the Farmors) <hi>above all other things labored to keep as a ſecret, which was the exceſsive gain every one of them made by the Farm.</hi> Secondly, that upon new alteration in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the Farm, there might com new undertakers, and ſo they might bee diſappointed of their monie that they had advanced, which after upon another occaſion fell out hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But ſure I am, divers of the beſt Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> and true Lovers of this Nation, have tole mee, and will juſtifie it to bee true, <hi>had I effected it to make free Ports all over the Nation fourteen years ago, the Common wealth had got Millions of monie by it before this time;</hi> then you would have had many ſcore of rich Merchants up &amp; down the Ports of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would have managed trade, not as it hath been: (the miſcarriage, I fear mee, hath in part been willingly, and require's a ſtrict examination) But if you had made Trade free, they would have kept ſtout Men of War at Sea, gon with Convoies, beeing readier to offend, then to take af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts at Sea; which would have been highly for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Nation, whoſe ſad loſſes moſt coming by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and the covetouſneſs of ſom Merchants, might have been all avoided, the loſſes, amounting within this twenty moneths to more then would have kept a Convoie ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defend all the Trade of this Nation for thirty years. If it bee examined, I do verily believ, it is not the <hi>French</hi> that take theſe ſhips, but our own Sea-men, that ſerv's them, and go's in by connivance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>I do humbly deſire that an enquirie may bee made after it by the Trinitie Houſ, and by all other waies what Engliſh Sea-men have been taken by the French in the ſhips lately taken within theſe twenty moneths, and where they now remain, and what Families they have, in or about</hi> LONDON, <hi>or other places in</hi> England, <hi>and how they live, and that their wives give an accompt where their husbands are, and in what ſervice. I am of an opinion you will finde a Pad in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119441:14"/> ſtraw, &amp; that you are robbed by your own Sea-men; and if it bee ſo, I humbly preſent unto you, that all waies and means bee found out for the diſcoverie of the truth, and ſtrict puniſhment bee inflicted on all ſuch Marriners that ſhall ſerv in any Forain Men of War, and their wives and families to bee ſequeſtred, their goods confiſcated as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traitors to this Nation.</hi> For ſuch ſhips as the <hi>French</hi> take, are taken moſt by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marriners, and are richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with Merchandize in the Straits; one of them is worth one hundred of their <hi>French</hi> Coaſters, or Fiſher-men, and there is never a ſhip of the Straitſ-men, but with the Lading will produce fifteen Men of War; for the <hi>French</hi> laie almoſt all out in ſhipping, that the return make's of their prizes: and by this rule I humbly deſire you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what their Increaſ is, and if ſom ſpeedie order bee not taken, wee ſhall not bee able to put a ſhip to ſea, but 'twill bee ſnapped in the Straits, beeing the beſt, richeſt, and ſtrongeſt Merchant's ſhips, wee have that Trade.</p>
                  <p>I praie God the neglecting it ſo long, do not coſt the Merchants and this Nation dear.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If you will make the Trade of this Nation flouriſh, I humbly conceiv you muſt make all Ports, where there are now Cuſtoms paid, to bee free Ports, for ſom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; as Wine, Fiſh, Salt, Corne, Wainſcot, Clap-boards, Maſts, Furs, Fur-deals, and Timber of all ſorts, Iron, Flax, Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Hops, Madder, and all other commodities of great bulk, to bee free to bring into any Port.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if not ſpent, to have Licence to tranſport them back, paying onely ſuch ſmall acknowledgments as they do in</hi> Amſterdam. But for fine goods, as Silks wrought or unwrought, Gold and Silver Threed, Bag-cloth, Lawns, Spices, and Drugs of all ſorts, and all other fine goods, none to bee laid upon the ſhore, or imported, till a true accompt were given to the <hi>Chief Officer of the Port, and good ſecuritie given, not to defraud the State either of the Cuſtoms or Exciſe, if ſpent in this Nation.</hi> And if any were found, either Merchants, or others, ſtealing Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119441:15"/> or Exciſe, the ſame puniſhment and penalties ſhould bee inflicted upon the offendor as in <hi>Holland;</hi> for it is but equal, that, if the Merchant deſire's the ſame privileges they have there, the offendor ſhould bee puniſhed by the ſame Laws they have; therefore for ſuch as deceiv the State, ſuch a ſtrict courſ would ſave much in managing the buſineſs both of Exciſe and Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>For I believ here are many ſlight fellows, put in inferior offices, which are corrupted; <hi>and when the Constable is a thief, the Felon will hardly bee found;</hi> For aſſoon as a poor fellow gett's into an office in the Exciſe or Cuſtoms, though his fee bee ſmall, onely to keep life and ſoul, yet you ſhall have many of them ſpend yearly ten times their ſalarie, which muſt bee don out of their gains, in an indirect waie. I am confident the Merchant or Tradeſ-man will not give <hi>ſuch fellows twelv pence, but they will deceiv the State of twentie ſhillings.</hi> Therefore the ſame rule as is in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Exciſe and Cuſtoms, or ſom ſtricter waie then is at preſent, would bee highly for the advantage of the State, in point of profit; for the penaltie is there ſo great, that no man will ſteal the duties; and it is ſit to bee ſo here, or elſ you will make onely honeſt men to paie, which make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And others, that will ſteal the duties, the penalties are ſo little, it encourageth them to ſteal the Exciſe and Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I humbly conceiv Order and Government in Trade is to bee look't after, eſpecially in theſe times, when the <hi>French</hi> take our ſhips ſo faſt, that every week almoſt bring's us one of <hi>Job's</hi> Meſſengers; <hi>And it is more then time ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voies went with our ſhips, and they not to com and go ſingle, but in Fleets, which cannot bee don but by a rule, and muſt bee under a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> (I have it from good hands) have made Proclamation, that none of their ſhips go into the <hi>Straits, France,</hi> or other parts without Convoie. Such a government as this, it is for the honor and ſafetie of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I heartily commend, and praie for, and would have all men put to their helping hand. <hi>But there are governments
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119441:15"/> which are for the private advantage of a few men, procuring prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Importation of ſeveral commodities but onely by particular men,</hi> and exportation of our Native commodities, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by particular men, and onely for ſom Ports, and at ſom ſeaſons of the year; I ſhall inſtance in ſom particulars for all the reſt, though there bee manie ſcore more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Green land Companie</hi> hath a power that no <hi>Dutch</hi> nor no others, ſhall bring in <hi>Green-land</hi> Oil, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of great uſe in this Nation, and if the Natives may have a free Market, they might bee ſerved ſom years twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and thirtie in the hundred cheaper, then they are forced to paie the <hi>Green-land</hi> Companie; And this is for the benefit of a few, to the dammage of the general.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Currants is a commoditie bought up all with readie monie, in <hi>Zant,</hi> and as Capt. <hi>Roberts</hi> ſaith, onely vented in <hi>England,</hi> and that ſo greedily coveted by this Nation, that the Natives thought wee made ſom dying ſtuff with them, and could not devour them; ſure I am, our Cloth is too good a commoditie to give them for ſuch ware. <hi>But for our Merchants, when they have monie for their return of our Cloth, to inveſt it again in Currants, and in ſuch quantities as will appear by the Cuſtom-Books everie year in this Nation;</hi> I ſhall humbly leav it to your Honors, to conſider of it, and that you would bee pleaſed to call for the Propoſitions and Petitions of thoſe Merchants, that the beginning of this Parlament procured an Act for the prohibiting the Importation of Currants; <hi>And that you would conſider of this branch of Trade ſeriouſly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee fit ſo much readie monie which elſ would bee returned into this Nation, ſhould bee ſpent in Cakes and Puddings, whereas in</hi> Spain, France, <hi>or any other Countrie where they grow, they eat none, and wee ſpend ten times more then all the world beſides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when theſe Currants are here, then the Merchants get a Prohibition that none but the <hi>Turkie</hi> Companie ſhall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Currants, and though Forrain Nations would ſell them thirtie in the hundred cheaper then the Merchants ſell them here, none muſt bee brought into the Nation: <hi>So
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119441:16"/> that by this Trade wee give monie for little better then dirt;</hi> it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vanitie, the Nation may verie well ſubſiſt without, and the Natives, if they will ſpend them, might have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie upon a free Trade thirtie in the hundred cheaper then they have paid for many years.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Cloth is the ſtaff of <hi>England's</hi> Trade, but of late, through the ſad diſtractions of theſe wars, and by the covetouſneſs of ſom people, both many work-men have unkindly left us, &amp; by many ſubtle waies and means, ſtoln away great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of unwrought Wooll, and Fuller's Earth, and ſo have laid the foundation of a <hi>Trade in Forrain parts.</hi> But as I am credibly informed, this was not the ground of ſetting up Cloth in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> but it did ariſe by other means, which was the Merchant-Adventurers. They kept their ſtaple but in two places, <hi>Hambrough</hi> and <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and there they tied men to ſuch rules for ſhow-daies, and other orders, by forcing all people to com ſom two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles to a Market, whereby the commodities in their Merchants coming down to buie them, and carriage up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrie was raiſed, and ſom difference hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Merchants Natives, in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>The great taxes laid here upon Cloth, to keep up their Companie by bribes, and paie the vaſt ſummes given in that behalf, the Formal waie of ſhipping but twice or thrice in the year, all which loaded and clogged the Cloth with ſuch a price at the Market, that Forrain Nations would no longer bee kept under theſe formal rules.</p>
                  <p>And knowing the advantage would com unto them, by getting the making of Woollen Cloth, labored by all means to attain to it, which they have don. But withal they gave our Clothiers all encouragement, and privileges, and put them upon ſuch wages, as they live better there then here.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wee muſt match the <hi>Dutch</hi> at their own weapons, and give them as great privileges, as they have given to our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119441:16"/> Clothiers in <hi>Holland;</hi> it will invite them hither, for our Harbors are better then theirs, and they are ſtraitned for want of room, and by this waie you will make <hi>England</hi> truly <hi>the Empreſs of the Sea, when everie Sea-Port-Town will bee an Amſterdam.</hi> I am informed, by the ableſt and beſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and I do believ them, that from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> there are ten Sea-Port-Towns, everie one of them lying more commodious for to make the Mart, and Bank for the world then <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> And beſides, North-ward, <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Woodbridge, Alburie, Sold, Lastof, Yarmouth,</hi> an excellent Haven, and ſafe Rode; <hi>Blackney, Wels, Linn, Boſton, Hull, New Caſtle,</hi> and many others, which by their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is no winde ſhall blow but ſhips ſhall go in and out, whereas but few windes will bring you in and out <hi>at Amſterdam, eſpecially in the Winter, beſides the danger of the Harbor of Texel.</hi> In Winter, ſomtimes in one year fortie Sail of ſhips and more caſt away, to the great damage of the Merchants, which would bee of a ſafer Harbor, if they can have free Trade, as they have at home.</p>
                  <p>If you embrace this motion, and make your Ports free, all the wealth that is brought from the Eaſt Kingdoms, and Hanſ-Towns, in <hi>Germanie</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and laid up in the Summer, there for Markets, will bee brought to our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Harbors, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhipping bee emploied in carrying Eaſt-Countrie Corn, Flax, Hemp, Timber, and all manner of Proviſion for <hi>Spain,</hi> and all other parts of the world, and make their returns in good pieces of Eight, then land them at the firſt Sea-Port, and away to Sea; this is a ſure waie to ſet the Mint a going, to emploie all our ſhipping, and return us to our former Trade.</p>
                  <p>And if you will let everie man com in to Trade, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their skill and abilities, that will, and let the rule bee equal to all people in Trade, let no man have a greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege then another; <hi>If this courſ bee followed, you would ſell two Clothes for one that is now ſold, you will not have Wooll enough in the Nation to make the Manufacture;</hi> and then you may In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs

                  <p>Theſe onely do and may buie, and that is onely when ſhipping is appointed by their Corporation: by which means the Clothiers Cloth lie's by the walls, and the poor want's emploiment, and Cloth muſt bee ſold, when, and at what rates, and time, the ſaid Merchants pleaſ to give, which occaſions the Clothier's for want of quick ſale, that they make not yearly the quantities of Cloth which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would do, and the poor periſh for want of work; &amp; this by reaſon of the ſaid Merchant's Corporation, and Prohibition of other men, which if free leav and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie were given to all men, to buie and tranſport Cloth, would occaſion the imploiment of many thouſand poor people, and the vent of a far greater quantitie of Woollen commodities then now is, which would bee a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to this Nation, in giving a comfortable livelihood to all the poor, and advance the Cuſtoms and Revenues of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119441:19"/> would bee duly paid, and it will bee undertaken to make here as good commodities of all ſorts of wearing Silks, and better and truer then beyond Seas; for there com's much falſ black into this Countrie, to the great prejudice of thoſe that wear them; and thoſe men that have an opinion, that nothing of this kinde can bee made good in their own Countrie, when they ſhall ſee the contratie daily practiſed, they will bee conſtrained by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to alter their imaginations, <hi>when they ſhall ſee thouſands of Families emploied, ſom as Throwsters, Silk-Diers, weaving at the Loom, by twiſting of the ſaid Silk, and alſo the working of all other neceſſaries that do depend thereupon; for of ſixteen ſhillings, which the ſmall pound of ſixteen ounces coſt, the firſt pennie when it is wrought in black Pluſh, or other Silks, it will yeeld at the least thirtie four, and thirtie five ſhillings</hi> per <hi>pound, ſo that full one half of all Silk Manufactured in this Nation, doth turn wholly to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the poor for Manufactures, a thing of high concernment to hee ſpeedily put in execution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like or greater improvement may bee made of Flax, Goat's hair, Cotton, Wooll, and Grogran Yarn, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers may receiv encouragement to bring ſom men from beyond Seas, to ſettle theſe new Arts and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures amongſt us, and ſo in a ſhort time, wee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Importation of all wrought Silks from beyond Seas, and make here what wee ſpend, and alſo get to that perfection, to furniſh moſt part of Chriſtendom, with Silk Manufactures, wee having the Trade, that can afford our raw Silk to the Loom, as cheap, and cheaper then moſt part of Chriſtendom, bringing it immediately by Sea from <hi>Perſia,</hi> which is the Fountain of raw Silk.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That you would bee pleaſed to make the late King's Houſ at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a Store-houſ for ſom commodities that ſhall bee Imported, and lie there for a Market, as Corn, Wine, Fiſh, Salt, Wainſcot, Clap-boards, Fur, Timber of all ſorts, Iron, Flax, Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Hops, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all other commodities of great bulk; and what

Your keeping this Staple, <hi>will ever avoid a dearth of Corn for the Citie of</hi> London, <hi>and have all commodities at the beſt hand.</hi>

If theſe Merchant Strangers, ſuch as abide here with their Families, were all Naturalized, ſom men ſaie, they would buie up all our Land, and in time ſupplant the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The Gentrie ſhould double and treble his ſtock in Land, the Tradeſ-man would have monie at five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Whereas hee paie's now eight and can hardly get it; beſides, they give with their daughters great portions; a tun, and two tuns of Gold with one of them, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie there.

                  <p n="18">18. I humbly deſire you to take into your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that upon a Medium, there was for ten years laſt paſt, about twentie thouſand tun of <hi>French</hi> Wines imported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119441:20"/> this Nation, till the Act prohibiting the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Wines.</p>
                  <p>That you would bee pleaſed to take notice, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Exciſe of the <hi>French</hi> Wines paid to the State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred thouſand pounds a year; and theſe <hi>French</hi> Wines, Casks and all, coſt not, the firſt pennie, in <hi>France,</hi> one hundred and fiftie thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, beſides the monie coming to the State upon the dutie for <hi>French</hi> Wines, thouſands of people get livelihoods by that Trade, which is verie conſiderable; as, <hi>firſt, our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping emploied, Vintners, Wine-Coopers, Car-men, Wine-Porters, Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larage,</hi> and many other people have their livelihood out of Wines imported from <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That many Merchants taking advantage of this Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>French</hi> Wines, Import Wines from <hi>Holland,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are <hi>Reniſh</hi> Wines; but the truth is, they are Wines mixed at <hi>Dort,</hi> and other places of <hi>Holland,</hi> and are ſmall <hi>Coniack</hi> Wines, of the growth of <hi>France,</hi> and after they are brewed and ſented in <hi>Holland,</hi> are Imported here for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Wines, which is verie unwholſom for men's bodies, &amp; ſold almoſt in all Taverns, when it is mixed with Red Wine for Claret Wine; ſo that the people paie dear for what is bad, it beeing ſold for twelv pence a quart, &amp; might bee afforded for ſix pence, and ſom Merchants get infinitely by ſelling theſe Wines. I humbly deſire it may bee ſeriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of; and if <hi>French</hi> Wines bee not admitted, that then there bee no <hi>Reniſh</hi> Wines Imported, for under color of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Wines ſold at the Still yard, they import all ſmall Wines of <hi>France,</hi> and ſell them at double the price they could bee afforded at the beſt hand.</p>
                  <p>But it is worthie a great deal of conſideration of your Honors, whether wee or the <hi>French</hi> loſe moſt, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, upon prohibiting of <hi>French</hi> Wines; I humbly leav it to your conſideration, whether the State doth not loſe more then the <hi>French,</hi> and if they do, then to prevent it for the future; <hi>For two hundred thouſand pounds a

                  <p n="19">19. Another Manufacturie of great concernment, is, making of all ſorts of Linnen Cloth within this Nation, and would ſet thouſands of people on work.

                  <p>I do moſt humbly deſire that a Law bee made, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie woman beyond the age of twelv years, within this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not beeing troubled with ſickneſs, bee injoined to ſpin one pound of Hemp or Flax everie moneth, and ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whoſe occaſions, or qualitie, will not, or cannot ſpin one pound of Flax or Hemp everie moneth, they paie to the uſe of the poor the ſumme of ſix pence for everie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhall not ſpin a pound of Flax and Hemp; and the Conſtable and Collectors for the poor of everie Pariſh, may bee injoined to levie it monethly, and to paie the ſaid ſumme in to the Juſtices of Peace of each Counties, to bee emplo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that ſuch prices and encouragements may bee ſettled in each Countie of this Nation, for the poor, for their labor of ſpinning, as by the Juſtices of the Peace in each Countie ſhall bee thought reaſonable, to give all the poor a competent ſubſiſtance, and to keep them from loitering and begging, by which means thouſands of Linnen-Weavers, who now live in great povertie, will have comfortable ſubſiſtance, and all the poor women in this Nation will for ever bleſs the remembrance of this Parlament, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo charitable a Law. And by this means, wee need not bee beholding to <hi>France</hi> for Canvaſs and Linnen for our ſhipping, or clothing, and wee ſhall keep the ſtock of our Nation amongſt us. Wee ſee the Town of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and many people in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> have grown rich onely by this

And if you pleaſ to give encouragement to ſom Forrain Linnen Weavers, onely for Cambrick and Holland, to com and plant in this Nation, and to have equal privilege, as they give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> you will have your Tiffanie, Cambrick, and Holland Weavers, com over and teach this Nation theſe Manufactures. <hi>And that which you now laie out (the Treaſure of this Nation beyond Seas) in vaſt ſummes, in buying theſe Manufactures for readie monie, you ſhall emploie the poor, keep in the ſtock of the Nation, and export ſo much to Forrain parts, as you ſhall ſpend here: by managing all the Trade in this manner,</hi> you would quickly double the ſtock of this Nation: for if you make your Exportation more in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue then your Importation, all what is above, is gotten to the State; The like argument hold's for loſs, that if you Import more Forrain commodities, then you do export Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the ballance muſt bee made up in monie. <hi>(And I have ſeen at Sir</hi> John Cooks, <hi>the late King's Secretarie (by whom I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moſt of theſe Obſervations) an accompt for many years, yearly preſented to Queen</hi> Elizabeth, of the exact Importation, and Exportation of Native and Forrain commodities, at everie Port, where Cuſtoms were paid; ſo that the Lord <hi>Burlie</hi> ſaw as in a Proſpective Glaſs, the increaſ or decreaſ of the ſtock of this Kingdom: And this accompt the Queen had yearly preſented by him to her. <hi>I praie God the Parlament would renue that Cuſtom, that ſo the State may know truly how the ſtock of the Nation stand's.</hi> By that means, they will know what commodities are commodious, and what prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ſo laie a great Cuſtom and Exciſe on that they finde ſuperfluous, and lighten and abate upon all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, where our poor have a livelihood by the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</p>

If you make a free Trade, you will, beſides all the former advantages, add one more, that is highly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Common-wealth in general, and to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in particular, as everie ingenious Merchant muſt bee forc't to confeſs; for whereas now wee give all the credit in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and many other Countries, and have none of their Merchants ſtocks here, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; whereby when an Imbargo cometh, the loſs fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, not onely upon the Merchant, but the Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for it fall's upon the Uſurer, the Clothier, the Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the work-man, and ſo by conſequence on the Gentrie; for the breaking of one great Merchant, make's the loſs fall on ten ſeveral Callings, and peradventure two hundred ſeveral Families; <hi>So that it is not the Merchant that ſuffer's, but the Nation in general. For I have ſeen a Merchant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his breaking, grow rich again, and I have ſeen ſom of that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Creditors receiv ſuch loſſes by the Merchant's breaking, that they and their Families have for ever been ruined, and this is no ſtrange ſight to ſee in</hi> London; Therefore, if you make a free Trade, you will have great ſtocks of Forrainers lie here in our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and on our Shores, that if any Imbargo com, as now at <hi>Lisborn,</hi> wee ſhould have had as much and more of the <hi>Portugal's</hi> goods in our hands, to have made our loſs good, as they had ſeized. All men know, that have ever been at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> what vaſt ſummes the <hi>Portugals</hi> have there, and if wee had <hi>free Trade, wee ſhould have all our Ports full of their goods;</hi> by which means, our Merchants could have made themſelvs whole; and it is highly for the ſecuritie of this Nation, to have as much Forrain commodities in our Ports, as wee ſend to any place, that ſo upon any oppreſſion of our Merchants, wee may have to make it good at home. And this, if Trade were free, and Merchants Strangers paid no more Cuſtoms, then the Natives, and had libertie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſport ſuch commodities as they could not vent here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had tried the Market, <hi>you would ever have their ſtocks here to make good any Imbargo laid on our Merchants beyond the Sea,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119441:22"/> a buſineſs of the higheſt advantage to this Nation, and greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of Trade that can bee; and if what I do with all humilitie propound, had been don fourteen years ago, when I firſt moved this buſineſs,</hi> it had prevented the ſad loſs our Merchants have ſuſteined at <hi>Lisborn;</hi> for if the <hi>Portugals</hi> had more goods here, then our Merchants there, it would have made good for the Merchants of both Nations; for an Imbargo had never been made at <hi>Lisborn,</hi> and ſo Trade would have gon on freely.</p>

Thus I have with all clearneſs, according to the beſt of my judgement, humbly preſented you that which coſt mee many years pains, and here laid down at your feet; beſides, I have the advice and approbation of the ableſt, and ſufficienteſt Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> who by long experience in <hi>Amſterdam, Legorn, Genoa,</hi> and other Forrain parts, know this to bee true, what is here ſet down, and to bee moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the State, in bringing in of a Nurſerie of able rich Merchants of all Nations, to contribute to the publick taxes; beſides, you will draw all the benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited to this Nation. The conſideration for the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die putting it in practice, is now moſt humbly preſented to your care, <hi>which will oblige this Common wealth to bleſs God for you, and after ages to have you in honorable remembrance, as the firſt Founders of laying a foundation of a free Trade.</hi> By which means, the <hi>Dutch</hi> from a ſmall and contemptible beginning, have held war againſt the moſt Potent Prince of Chriſtendom, and after fourſcore years war, compell'd him to give them their own conditions, have made themſelvs rich and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Eaſt and Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> and their <hi>Amſterdam the Mart of Christendom.</hi> Let us by their examples, invite all Merchant Strangers, giving them the ſame privileges as they have there; Our Ports are far better and ſafer for all the Trade of the world, then theirs; by this means, you will contract the wealth of the world, you will increaſ in ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Manufacture, and all the precious things of this world; you will make all our Sea Ports, as it was ſaid

Concerning the management of the Cuſtom, I humbly conceiv, as they are now carried on, is not to the beſt improvementt of the State, in point of the Revenue, nor ſafetie to the Common-wealth; for in the ſeveral Sea-Ports of this Nation, and in the Cuſtom-houſ at <hi>London,</hi> none ought to bee emploied in Offices of Truſt, but skilful men, and men of Eſtates, that if any miſcarriage com, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates might bee reſponſible to the State: And whereas ſom men are of an opinion, that they would have Trade free, to Import all commodities, and Export all without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, not for Leather, Fuller's Earth, Corn, Wooll, Ammunition, Gold and Silver, Horſes, and all other things that are the ſtaff and ſtaie of this Nation; I would not write it, but I have it affirmed by men of great qualitie, that this is the opinion of ſom men that are in place and power. Truly I humbly conceiv, there cannot bee a more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive thing to this Common-wealth, then that thoſe men's principles ſhould bee followed: And I humbly conceiv, that it would verie greatly conduce towards the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Trade, that if there were ſuch Officers ſettled in the Cuſtom-houſ, as by virtue of the ancient Laws of the Nation formerly were, who were men of known qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and did not onely put in ſufficient ſecuritie ſecuritie to anſwer to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And all Jailors, and Keepers of Priſons, are commanded to keep and arreſt the priſoners committed unto them by the ſaid Prior and Conſuls, as they do the priſoners of all other Judges, under the ſame penaltie and bonds, without demanding leav or licence of other Judges, or any other perſon whatſoe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver.</p>
                     <p>And all Judgments of the ſaid Prior and Conſuls, ſhall bee executed throughout all the King's Dominion, bee it by attachment of goods and ſale thereof, arreſt, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of perſons condemned, as alſo by penalties and forfeitures of monie, according to the cauſ of the offence; And all Noble Perſonages and others, as well Spiritual-men and Laie-men, of age or under age, or their Deputies, uſing and exerciſing the Trade of Merchandizing, or Exchange, ſhall in that reſpect bee ſubject to the Power and Autoritie of the Prior and Conſuls; and all other Judges are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to intermeddle concerning ſuch debates and differences, growing between Merchants.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Priors and Conſuls, with the Merchants their aſsiſtants, are required to bee juſt and careful, and ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119441:24"/> to avoid giving of offence to other Judges, by raſh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid Conſuls, and Prior, have likewiſe in charge, the puniſhing of all frauds, abuſes, deceits, falſification, and all other ill dealing in Merchandizes, and all abuſes committed in the courſ of Exchanges. All Civil Cauſes between men of what qualitie ſoëver, beſides thoſe which concern Trade of Merchandize, or matters of Exchange, bee all exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Juriſdiction of the Prior and Conſuls, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or parties grieved may accuſe the ſaid Prior and Conſuls, &amp; other Juriſdictions of this Court, if they have lawful cauſ ſo to do, and that not in writing, but by word of mouth, in the preſence of them they charge. And their accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall bee ſummarily examined, juſtly decided, and if the ſaid Prior or Conſuls bee parties, then the Priors or Conſuls for the five laſt years paſt, or ſo many as are in bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall adjung the cauſ. And if the ſaid Prior or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls ſhall bee accuſed, and juſtly proved of any corruption, then they are not to give ſentence, but the moſt ancienteſt and eminenteſt Merchants, and thoſe that have the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in the Exchange, ſhall ſit in the place of the ſaid Prior and Conſuls, and give Judgment without any ſalarie to bee given to the ſaid Merchant, in regard of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Merchant that ſhall bee choſen, Prior, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and Clerks of the Court, muſt bee free Denizens, or elſ naturalized, and married in the Citie of <hi>Roan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The elections of the ſaid Prior yearly, muſt bee made before a Committee of two Counſellors, named and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Parlament for that purpoſe, and the Clerk of the Enſurance Office, muſt bee an Inhabitant in the Citie of <hi>Roan,</hi> in ſom publick and eminent place which ſhall bee aſsigned for that purpoſe. And in <hi>Paris,</hi> you have one Judg, and four Conſuls, with the like Juriſdiction as they have at <hi>Roan</hi> for Merchants, and by their Charter, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all Judges not to intermeddle in any cauſ concerning Merchandize and Exchange, upon the penaltie of making
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119441:25"/> void the Suit, and of Arbitrarie amercements, charges and damages, and intereſts of the parties grieved, as well of the ſaid Judges, as againſt the Laws, and Atturnies injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Sergeants everie one of them in their turns to aſsiſt, &amp; to bee preſent at the daies and hours, in which the Court of the ſaid Prior and Conſuls uſeth to bee kept, &amp; there to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſilence, and to put in uſe and execution, their Orders and Commands, and to give them ſuch honor and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as they owe unto Magiſtrates, injoining all our good Subjects to do the ſame. And if there ſhall ariſe a Diſpute or Controverſie, whereby the Merchants ſhall conceiv they have not juſtice of the Prior and Conſuls, for the time beeing, then all ſuch Merchants, that have been Priors and Conſuls, and are remaining in the Citie of <hi>Roan,</hi> without they bee hindred by ſickneſs, or other juſt excuſe, ſhall make a Court of Merchants, and there, after they have taken an Oath, to do equal juſtice, they ſhall give the ſentence, which ſhall bee binding to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties irrevocable for the time to com.</p>
                     <p>This Court is at this daie in uſe in many great Cities in <hi>France,</hi> by which means, Law-ſuits are ſpeedily diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the great eaſ of all Merchants, both Natives and Strangers, and they finde the good and ſpeedie juſtice which all men have there.</p>
                     <p>I humbly deſire, that the principal Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> might bee conſulted withal, and their humble deſires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Court of Merchants, which may bee ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which will bee a great eaſ and benefit to the Merchants, and to all honeſt-minded men that are Traders, to have their Suits for Merchandize and Traffick determined amongſt themſelvs, to have their differences ſpeedily diſpatched, and not delaied as it hath been, to the ruine of many Families in this Citie and Nation.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. That this Council require the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Companie, to bring in their Charter, whereby you will inform your ſelvs, with what privilege they have granted them, and upon what conditions and reſtrictions.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. Your Petitioner deſire's you to take notice, that if the State in Parlament were then ſo careful in times of peace, and the Trade of the Nation flouriſhing, to call the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Companie to an accompt for twentie years, and to cauſ them to make their accompts plainly to appear by their Books for twentie years; ſurely, I humbly conceiv, this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Council will exſpect for the ſervice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to have an exact accompt of all the Treaſure the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Companie have exported; and to have them to produce a juſt accompt what quantities of Gold or Silver they have bought in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in other Forrain places, immediately upon their proper accompt; and what quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> melted Silver in Bars, they have bought of Goldſmiths in <hi>London;</hi> what quantities of Gold in Bars, they have bought of the <hi>Guinie</hi> and <hi>Barbarie</hi> Companies, what quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> coined Gold they have ſent into the Eaſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> and to <hi>Perſia;</hi> what quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Cardqueſs, Rex-Dollars, Rials of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other Forrain Silver, they have bought up in <hi>Londou,</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Goldſmiths, or others, which without the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <hi>India</hi> Companie ſo buying, would have been brought into the Mint and coined, to the great augmentation of the ſtock of this Nation. And that they bee required to give you an Accompt of what qnantities of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtollers, <hi>Dutch</hi> Riders, <hi>Hungarian</hi> Duckets, Gold <hi>Gilders,</hi> Gold <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Flanders, Italian</hi> Piſtolets, <hi>Turkie</hi> Sultels, and all other Forrain

And that the aforeſaid Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bee required to ſend you in all the Warrants and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their doing of the ſame, and for a true diſcoverie of the premiſes.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That you would require the Books of Invoies of the Lading of everie ſhip of all the Gold and Silver, in Bars, or Coin, that hath been ſent to the Eaſt-<hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſince 1620. for by them you ſhall ſee what Gold and Silver each ſhip carried, and the Ships, Factors, and Maſter's names, and to what Factorie in <hi>Perſia</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> and the ſeveral years, and ſo you will quickly ſee the juſt quantitie to a pennie, what they have tranſported, and in what ſort of Coin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Engliſh Gold or Silver, or Forrain Gold or Silver, for theſe thirtie years; the giving you a true accompt thereof, will bee of great concernment to the Common-wealth in many reſpects.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. That you would appoint a Committee to view over the Journal Books: for out of them there will bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red buſineſſes of great concernment to the Nation; and if ſom able Book-Keepers bee appointed with mee, to take out what I ſhall obſerv in them, it will tend highly to the ſervice of the Nation, and give a ſtop to great miſchiefs that is daily practiſed on the Common-wealth.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If you pleaſ to inform your ſelvs by this waie, you will ſee clearly many other ſecrets, upon peruſal of theſe Books, then I will ſpeak of, and ſo you will bee able to rectifie &amp; ſettle the Trade in a flouriſhing condition, that it may bee beneficial to the Common wealth, and all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, whereas heretofore, &amp; now as it is managed, none getteth by it, but the Committees of the ſaid Companies, and the Companie's Factors and their Officers. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers having been blinded ever ſince it was a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,

I humbly conceiv upon the Examination of all the premiſes, when that the Books of the Companie are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it will bee found that the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Companie hath ſent away the Common-wealth's Coin, both in Gold and Silver. I am the more encouraged to ſpeak this plainly to you, becauſ I know there is now no Lord Treaſurer, no Lord Privie Seal, no Bed-chamber-men, nor Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to bribe, nor as I hope any elſ to bee bribed, to take off and ſuppreſs the juſt examination of abuſes in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which heretofore have been proved to have been a common Trade w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For I ſee there are ſom which either out of ſpite to the welfare of this Nation, or by the ſubtiltie of the tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold and Silver, and cullers out of the heavie currant Coins of this Nation, have engaged themſelvs to obſtruct this great Service, <hi>that ſo the Common-wealth may bee circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ſurest ſtrength, Monie, which is the ſinews of war, and ſtrength of the Nation, and thoſe people that abound with it, are able to command all things in the world;</hi> And that Common-wealth and Familie that is without it, is made uncapable of doing any great action. Beſides, by this dangerous Maxim, as much as in them lie's, they labor to darken and weaken the ſplendor and ſtrength of your Armie, which hath don ſuch great things; for if your Treaſure all bee exhauſted, how ſhall they bee paid? <hi>And theſe tenets at the beſt ſmell of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, if not of a Jeſuitical deſign.</hi> And I do moſt humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Council of War would reſent it, it concern's the ſafetie and well-beeing of the Armie, the keeping of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within the Nation; for they, and the Armie are like a ſhip at ſea, which muſt bee well-provided with Anchors and Cables, and Victuals; monie is to them all this, nay, everie thing. And for thoſe that have maliciouſly oppoſed the Act, for prohibiting tranſporting of Gold and Silver, I make no queſtion to finde a time to call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; For others that deſire to have the queſtion truly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I will with all willingneſs and humilitie preſent what former ages have don, and this preſent time require's. Firſt, I humbly preſent to you, that the treaſure of <hi>England</hi> is but like a quantitie of water in a Ciſtern; wee have no ſprings of treaſure, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> everie year to bee ſupplied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119441:29"/> from the Weſt-<hi>Indies;</hi> and therefore it concern's us to keep in our treaſure, for beeing once tranſported, it cannot bee drawn back, but by inhancing of monie, to the ruine of all the owners of Land and ſettled Revenues; for ſo much as you raiſ monie, you take from all Landlords. To this is replied, wee may bring monie from <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other parts of Chriſtendom, freely, and therefore it ought to bee as free here in <hi>England,</hi> and it is no prejudice to the Common-wealth; and this is the opinion of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that I believ love the Common-wealth, and ſpeak not out of a deſign to prejudice either the Nation, or Armie; for theſe men I humbly offer theſe reaſons to conſider.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>Holland,</hi> when it was made a new State, the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carts and Edicts ſhew, which I cauſed to bee Tranſlated, <hi>What ſevere penalties they put upon tranſporting of monie;</hi> And made it Baniſhment, Confiſcation of goods, Impriſonment, and Corporal puniſhments; they knew Monie was the principal Ammunition of their Nation, for having that, they could want neither Men, Victual, nor Arms, and this they did at the beginning of their Wars, which is now our condition, and wee ought to follow this rule.</p>
                     <p>But now in <hi>Holland,</hi> by long continuance of Trade, great thrift and abundance of ſhipping, they are no other then a Bank or Ware-Houſ; they have little lands or houſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt their ſtocks in, but muſt put it into commodities and monie. And ſince, by God's bleſſing upon their induſtrie, they have in a Spot of Ground, contracted the wealth of Chriſtendom. And ſo abounding in Monies, and not knowing how to inveſt it, let it bee granted, that they let monie bee exported freely, this make's nothing that wee ſhould do ſo now, for the reaſons following.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In <hi>England,</hi> by the Statute, any man may tranſport Corn freely, when it is at four ſhillings a Buſhel, becauſ of the abundance, that ſo the Farmer may paie his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and keep his Houſ, and paie Laborers for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Ground, and Threſhing it in the Barn. Doth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119441:29"/> the Law allow any man to carrie Corn when it is 10 or 12 s. a Buſhel out of the Nation, by that means you may ſtarv the poor, and any that ſhould do it, deſerveth the higheſt puniſhment; my Argument upon this follow's, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us attein ſo much before-hand <hi>in ſtock of monie,</hi> as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have, bee in ſo flouriſhing a condition of Trade as they are, <hi>hee maſter of all the ſubtilties of the Banks and Exchanges in Chriſtendom, as they are,</hi> which they make that uſe of, as they do of their Sluces, for water, ſo they let in and out all the Treaſure of Chriſtendom to their own advantage; then I ſaie, with all chearfulneſs, tranſport Monie as they do, and freely, and as you do tranſport Corn, when it is at four ſhillings a Buſhel, but till you have that plentie of Monie to paie your Fleet, to paie your Armies, to maintein Trade, and Commerce, and all theſe in a plentiful manner, keep your Laws in force, follow the Offendors with ſevere and ſharp puniſhments, as you do, when there is a death of Corn, puniſh the tranſporters of Corn, with the ſevereſt puniſhments, as Murtherers, and Deſtroiers of the poor. And this is a certain Maxim, that <hi>That Common-wealth that hath Monie plentifully, can command all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. I ſhall leav it to the capacitie of any reaſonable man that ſee's; you may receiv one thouſand pounds in a pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not twentie ſhillings in Gold; you ſhall receiv one hundred pounds in Silver, and not fiftie pounds of it but clipped, and lighter then the Standard, as it com's out out of Tower, all our weightie Monie beeing melted into Ingots, and ſent beyond Seas; you ſhall have fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in a paiment in <hi>Holland,</hi> all of <hi>Engliſh</hi> half Crowns, and this is known to all men that know <hi>France</hi> and Forrain parts, that our Gold is fortie times more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> then here.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You have ſom Goldſmiths that have conſtantly bought the clipped <hi>Engliſh</hi> monie, many times over of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral people, (and put it away again) and ſo make the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119441:30"/> Cheat run round like a Horſ in the Mill, and cozen the whole Nation; you ſhall not receiv in many Towns of this Nation, not in five hundred pounds paiment, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds of good Monies, ſuch as the Gentrie or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants can paie away again in <hi>London;</hi> And if hee bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by reaſon of his occaſion, to paie Monie in <hi>London,</hi> hee muſt <hi>ſell it in</hi> London <hi>to the Goldſmiths, at above twentie pound in the hundred loſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſom Goldſmiths ſo buying it, ſell it to the Graſiers, Receivers of Publick Caſh, or ſom one or other, that the Gentleman is ſure to have it paid him the next Quarter in the Countrie. And if theſe Cheats muſt bee ſpoken for, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and by ſom publickly warranted, there ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs a Law to have the Offendors puniſhed. The draught of this Act of Parlament, was drawn by Order of the Council of State, and ſeveral times debated upon a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> the Certificate of the Officers of the Mint, the Officers of the Cuſtoms, the Committee of the Navie, and yet nothing don in it, to the unſpeakable hazard, and damage of the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>I do humbly beſeech you conſider the great ſummes of Monie the Navie take's up everie year, and the Armies with both their appurtenances; and theſe, it is true, waſte not the treaſure of the Nation by tranſportation, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main's conſtantly amongſt us, and without theſe neceſſarie ſupports, the ſplendor and ſafetie of the Common-wealth would bee undermined, <hi>which is the heartie deſire of ſom of the Presbyterian partie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thoſe that are verſed in the managing of theſe great Affairs, know you muſt conſtantly provide the Sea-man's paie, with the Victuals, and Soldier's paie, beſides the Train of Artillerie, and an hundred other neceſſaries incident to a Fleet and Armie, and without Monie all theſe ſtrengths ceaſ as a Clock doth when you take off the weights. I ſhall humbly leav it to everie judicious man, what the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of the treaſure is, according to the conjuncture of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119441:30"/> this time, and as your Affairs now ſtand, for many other deſignes may undermine the State by degrees. <hi>But the tranſporter of treaſure now in theſe times, is a Powder-Plotter,</hi> hee blow's up Parlament, Armie, Fleet, and Common-wealth, all at once, and yet ſom, through ignorance, ſpeak for them; but let the tranſporters of Gold and Silver, and the cullers and melters of the heavie Coin of this Nation, run their courſ a little longer, (which God defend) they will leav no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the Nation; and then, when it is too late, you will finde as <hi>Sampſon's</hi> ſtrength laie in his hair, ſo the ſinews of War is Monie; and, if formerly they deſerved to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the purſ, that were tranſporters of monie, cullers, &amp; melters down of the heavie currant Coin of the Nation, they much more deſerv to die for it now, for it is undermining of the whole State; And what in time of peace, in this particular was a miſdemeanor, I humbly conceiv for the ſafetie of the Common-wealth, ought to bee made Felonie at this time, conſidering the multiplicitie of your occaſions.</p>
                     <p>I do therefore humbly deſire, that the Act may bee ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſpatched; and not delaied, by the ſubtiltie of a few men, to the ruine and deſtruction of the Common-wealth; for without it paſs, you will not have Monie left to paie your Armies, your Navie, nor maintain Commerce.</p>
                     <p>It is not an Act of Parlament can levie Monie, if you take not preſent Order to keep it in the Nation. And therefore (I moſt humbly praie) as you love the ſafetie of your ſelvs, and the Armie, keep the treaſure in this Common-wealth (which is yet left) by making tranſporting treaſure Felonie for the future, &amp; puniſh thoſe that have tranſported the treaſure, and give all encouragement and privilege to ſuch as bring in Silver and Gold into your Mint.</p>
                     <p>I humbly deſire, that all private intereſt in this particular, may, by the Autoritie of the Parlament, bee ſuppreſſed, which ſhall bee proved to bee againſt the Publick. <hi>And that Briberie may bee examined, and branded with all infamie, which have kept up the corrupt intereſt of many Companies, to cheat
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119441:31"/> the Common-wealth, and obſtruct the paſsing of good Laws, for the benefit of the Nation. Yet I do most humbly declare to you, I am for all good Orders in Companies, both Merchants and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo far as it is not prejudicial to the Common-wealth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this which I have with all humilitie ſaid, ſhall finde a favorable conſtruction with your Honors, and that it have life from your Honors countenance &amp; protection, and that you put forth your ſelvs, to ſee that theſe things bee put in execution, according to the power you have in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, I ſhall thank God for it, and I ſhall bee well content, that you have ſeen that in an hour, that coſt mee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years pains and ſtudie. And I ſhall bee willing, for the ſervice of this Common-wealth to take ſom pains to enlarge my ſelf in theſe particulars, if my humble advice bee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For though I love not to give an accompt of my faith to a Presbyter Elder, yet with all humilitie, I conceiv my ſelf bound, and I am readie to give the State an accompt in what I can ſerv the Common-wealth, when I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ſhall and can do it with more chearfulneſs, they many a Presbyter, that have falſly charged mee to bee a Malignant, and without the Juſtice of the Parlament, have robbed mee of my Eſtate, to a great value, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was as yet heard to obtain a hearing. And that I may have Juſtice, is all my humble deſire, to your Honors. In the procuring mee Juſtice, I ſhall bee ever bound to praie for your Honor's happineſs here and hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>The Total of the ſaid Fines amount to the ſumme of</hi> 24100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John Wollaſton</hi> Knight, and <hi>William Gibs</hi> Eſquire, both Aldermen of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> beeing informed againſt in this Information, by the late King's then Atturnie Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, procured the late King's Pardon, and ſo were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Peter Fountain,</hi> who was informed againſt for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting of Gold, procured his Pardon upon paiment of 1100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. And all theſe I did bring to a Trial, all at my own charge.</p>
                  <p>That beſides the fourteen offendors ſentenced in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and pardoned, as aforeſaid, there are many other Merchants, Gold-ſmiths, and others, that have tranſported
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119441:34"/> Gold and Silver out of the Nation, that have ſold Gold and Silver at above the price of the Mint, that have furniſhed much light Gold, Engliſh and Forrain, and great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gold and Silver to Merchants, and others to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that have culled and melted down the weightieſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſilver Coins, as ſhillings, ſix pences, &amp; half crowns, all which offences are againſt the common Laws of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the Wiſdom and Policie of State hath, upon free and general pardons at Parlaments, exempted it out of the free pardon, thereby the more to terrifie and reſtrain men from venturing in that kinde, to tranſport Gold or Silver, or to melt down the currant Silver Coins of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>That divers Gold-ſmiths of <hi>London,</hi> are becom Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Bullion of Gold and Silver, and buy it of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others, pretending to carrie it to the Mint, but indeed they are the greateſt Inſtruments for tranſporting that are; and in a manner, they are onely thoſe who furniſh tranſporters with Engliſh and Forrain Gold, Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Rix-dolars, Piſtollers, Cardacues, culling and melting down the currant Silver Coins of this Realm for Plate and Silver-Thread; and no doubt, when a true repreſentation of the abuſes of ſuch Gold-ſmiths, Finers, &amp; Wier drawers, as hath been formerly, and is daily practiſed by many of them, ſhall bee made appear; I doubt not, but the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will think fit to take the ſame into conſideration, and provide ſom means to reſtrain them from doing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that damage, as formerly hath been don.</p>
                  <p>That ſom of the Goldſmiths make it their uſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to by light Engliſh Gold of ſhop-keepers, and others, which by the Laws of this Nation, wanting beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, ought to bee bought as Bullion, and upon the ſale, ought to bee defaced, and new coined in the Mint: But they take another waie; for they ſell all this Gold to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, though it want four, five, or ſix grains above the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and that a Twentie ſhilling piece will not make nineteen ſhillings to bee coined in the Mint; yet the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119441:35"/> Gold-ſmiths will not abate above two pence or three pence, and ſomtimes but one pennie in the piece, let the Gold want what it will; by which means, they out-give the Mint: And the Gold which the Gold-ſmiths buie of the Subjects, thinking it is to carrie to the Mint to bee new coined to paſs in currant paiment, they put it into a dead Sea, never to bee made uſe of in our Common wealth: For weekly, French and Engliſh have bought up this Gold, let it bee as light as it will, at higher prices then the Mint are allowed to give by their Indenture, to the value of many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds; for by the Gold-ſmith's rule, the Mint is alwaies laſt ſerved, as beeing the worſt Chap man, and giving leaſt for it; for after all hands are full, both for tranſporters, Plate-workers, Finers, and Wier-drawers; then that, which they cannot vent otherwiſe, cometh into the Mint; which the Officers of the Mint know verie well: and if Gold and Silver never came into the Gold-ſmith's hands, (which Merchants ſell to them, believing they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it all to bee coined) far more Gold and Silver would com into the Mint, then now doth.</p>
                  <p>And for this laſt 5 years, ſom Gold ſmiths have given for Engliſh Gold twentie ſhillings ſix pence, twentie one ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſix pence, and twentie two ſhillings, for a twentie ſhillings piece, which for the moſt part have been bought of them by Merchants, ſtrangers, and others, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the Nation, ſo that now you may receiv five thouſand pound in a paiment, &amp; never a piece in Gold: If this ought not to bee looked after, and the offendors brought to Juſtice, I ſhall humbly leav it to the Parlament to conſider.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, many thouſand of Dolars &amp; pieces of Spaniſh Monie they furniſh Merchants yearly with that Trade for <hi>Norwaie</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other parts, and tranſport Silver for thoſe parts, to the great weakning of the ſtock of this Nation, and hinderance of the ſale of our woollen commodities, which (before that pernitious waie was found out) thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119441:35"/> Countries vented much of. Beſides the hinderance of the ſale of our commodities, the State is hindered of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; for the Merchants drive a Trade inward &amp; outward, &amp; ſo paie the State no Cuſtom; for inſtance, <hi>Hambrough.</hi>-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bring great quantities of Rix-dollars from <hi>Hambrough</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and paie no Cuſtom, becauſ the State hath ever made Gold and Silver free to bee imported without Cuſtom, which the Merchants uſually ſell to the Gold-ſmiths, &amp; the Gold-ſmiths for the moſt part ſell to the Merchants that trade in <hi>Norwaie</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> which Dollars are cloſely packed in ſom part of the ſhip, and ſo no Cuſtom paid, either for bringing in the Silver, or ſending it out; and no commodities, in a manner, other then Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; are tranſported into thoſe parts by the ſaid Merchants, conſidering the quantitie of their return; for what they want in goods exported from hence, they muſt make up in monie: If great returns of commodities from <hi>Norwaie</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and few commodities exported from hence, the Ballance muſt bee made up with Silver; for no Nation will give us commodities, but there muſt bee a Ballance for goods imported, by goods exported, or by treaſure.</p>
                  <p>It is to bee feared, that the induſtrie of many ages can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repleniſh the Nation with ſo much Gold, as hath been tranſported out of it within theſe few years; for it is an infallible rule, that, <hi>where Gold and Silver is over-valued, thither will it bee tranſported by Merchants and others;</hi> for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reſort's, where it is moſt made of; and if you ſeek to raiſ it here, the remedie is worſ then the diſeaſ; for then you take from the Gentrie and all ſettled Revenuers, as much of their means, as you raiſ the currant monie; for if Gold ſhould bee raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> for example, the twentie ſhillings, to twentie ſix ſhillings, as it was in <hi>France,</hi> either higher or lower, you ſhould buie no more at your Market for twentie ſix ſhillings, then you could before for your twentie ſhillings; and contrariwiſe, if your twentie ſhillings were but fourteen ſhillings, you ſhould buie as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119441:36"/> much for your fourteen ſhillings, as when it paſſed at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhillings; ſo that whenſoever monie is raiſed, the loſs falleth moſt upon the Nobilitie and Gentrie, and certain Revenuers, who loſe ſo much out of their inheritance, which they have let out in Leaſ, as Monie raiſed.</p>
                  <p>All Merchants that trade for <hi>Spain,</hi> know, that when the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Fleet cometh not into <hi>Spain,</hi> the trade for that year is loſt; and <hi>No monie, no trade.</hi> If this bee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule for <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſuffer's ſo much for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of bringing in of treaſure for one year, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the next out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and till their Fleet came home, no dealing with Merchants; I do moſt humbly preſent, how much more it doth concern this Nation, which hath no <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to ſupplie the treaſure tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to provide, and carefully keep in the Nation's ſtock, which once tranſported, cannot bee drawn back, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unreaſonable terms; which will impoveriſh all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to an ineſtimable value; and as long as it remaineth out of the Nation, all Trading and Commerce decaieth, the Subjects are unable to paie taxes, and other duties, and it is one of the greateſt miſchiefs that can befall the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                  <p>1. Theſe reaſons amongſt many other, I humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Parlament, <hi>April</hi> 12, 1643. which if they had been then taken into conſideration, had kept many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Monie in the Nation. But by the ſubtiltie of two Aldermen, whoſe pardon I had got from the late King, I for my reward was committed to the Tower, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Letter from the late King, though I had a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Houſ of Commons, and a Warrant from my Lord General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> for to go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at <hi>Darbie-houſ</hi> knew of my going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the late King's Letter, which I deſired Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever I went, to have him acquaint the Committee of both Nations at <hi>Darbie-houſ</hi> with my buſineſs, &amp; ſom other of the Houſ of Commons, and that I would not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119441:36"/> their leav, which I had from them by him; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rilie</hi> the Scout-maſter of <hi>London,</hi> procured my paſs from the Houſ of Commons.</p>
                  <p>But the truth was, the Presbyterian partie ruled then all, and they were reſolved to make their Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> rich, and had a deſign to circumvent this Nation, both of all their Gold, Monie, &amp; Moveables; which for a great part they have don, as I will make it appear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any that did ſpeak againſt Tranſporting Treaſure, or knew ſo much of their tricks as I did, muſt bee a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, an enemie to the Covenant; and ſo I was kept three years and eleven moneths priſoner in the Tower, almoſt three years of that time cloſe, becauſ I ſhould tell no tales; and my Eſtate given away without hearing, and Sequeſtred to my damage, to the value of above eight thouſand four hundred pounds.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the infinite waies the Presbyterians found out for to enrich their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which all the Nation know; I ſhall declare one, which was ſo uſurious and deſtructive to the Nation, as never the like practice was before put on this Nation, nor I believ, ſcarcely upon any other, under the color of Friendſhip, League, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp; this to bee don upon their dear Brethren of <hi>London,</hi> and that was briefly this. The <hi>Scot's</hi> Commiſſioners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an Ordinance, that no ſhips ſhould bring Coals from <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> as appear's at large by the Ordinance. When this was don, They muſt bee the onely men muſt bring us Coals from <hi>Scotland;</hi> whereas before our dear Brethren brought us Coals for nine and ten ſhillings the Tun, and ſold them delivered at <hi>London</hi> at that price, as will appear by all the Wood-monger's books; they having by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of their Faction, got all their trade for Coals for the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of the Nation, into their hands, then the Citie ſhall paie for their Brotherly aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For ſince the Ordinance for reſtraint of fetching Coals from <hi>New-Castle,</hi> until <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> was reduced to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119441:37"/> the Parlament, <hi>Scotch</hi> Coals were at thirtie and fortie ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Tun; ſo that they ſold them after they had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoliz'd the Coals into their own hands, at four times the value they could, and did conſtantly before, afford to bring them from <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the Sea-Coals, which upon a medium for ten years before were all the Summer under twentie ſhillings a Chaldron delivered; during all the time the <hi>Scots</hi> were in <hi>England</hi> with their Armie, were at three pound, four pound, and five pound a Chaldron, as all the Inhabitants of the Citie of <hi>London</hi> know.</p>
                  <p>Then they had their Factors here, to buie up all the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Bedding, Pewter, Stools, Chairs, Houſhold-ſtuff, Pictures, and all manner of Lumber, which was ſold to the value of many hundred thouſand of pounds, out of the Citie of <hi>London</hi> and Nation, for half the value, and by them in ſtead of Ballaſt carried to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and this can bee witneſſed by thouſands of people, who have to their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal undoing ſuffered in this kinde, and are never likely to ſee their goods, nor never to bee Maſters of ſuch again, without they, or their Children will take the pains to go <hi>Scotland</hi> to fight for them: By this waie they may recover their goods, or their value again. I have been told by ſeveral Gentlemen of credit that live in the North, that when the <hi>Scotch</hi> Armie was with them in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>New-Castle,</hi> they have ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſoldiers date their Letters with this title, <hi>From New Caſtle in Scotland; From Ferrie-Brig in Scotland; From York in Scotland;</hi> and ſo other places where their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie came in <hi>England,</hi> they took it all for <hi>Scotland.</hi> But God hath put a Hook in their noſtrils, and ſent them back, and now the victorious <hi>Engliſh</hi> may in requital date all their Letters, if they pleaſ, <hi>From Edinburgh in England:</hi> and ſo I praie God it may continue to the world's end.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall humbly deſire the Parlament to take notice after what rate the Brotherly aſsiſtance from <hi>Scotland</hi> came in to help their Brethren, even, after the rate of ſending one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119441:37"/> hundred pounds worth of Coals to <hi>London,</hi> to their dear Brethren, to make their return worth eight hundred pounds in a moneth, or ſix weeks time, as it is apparent, and can bee witneſſed by thouſands of people, now they read this. Which after this rate, a poor <hi>Scotch-man</hi> might with one hundred pounds, within the compaſs of one year, cheat this Nation of ten thouſand pounds, and tranſport it all in Monie. And this hath been don by many of them, to the value of many hundred of thouſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>And becauſ I Petitioned the Parlament, to look to the tranſporting of the treaſure, by which means, they would have been prevented in ſending the treaſure of this Nation into <hi>Scotland,</hi> I muſt bee Sequeſtred, Impriſoned in the Tower, and held a Malignant.</p>
                  <p>But I humbly hope the Parlament will give mee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for my juſt defence; and when they ſhall by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence finde, that this I ſaie to bee true, and that I diſcover the neſt of them that have robbed this Nation, they will do mee right, and unlooſ mee from oppreſſion, and reſtore mee to my Eſtate.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119441:46"/> Hee that export's the Treaſure of the Nation, either in Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or currant Coin, beeing taken, loſeth them: hee that melt's down the currant Gold or Silver of the Nation for Plate or other Manufactures, commit's a forfeiture; and tranſporting of treaſure hath formerly been made Felonie, as by the ſeveral Statutes and Laws to this purpoſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                        <p>By theſe and divers other Laws and Statutes, our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors have endeavored the retention and preſervation of the Coin and Treaſures within this Nation, but could hitherto never effect it.</p>
                        <p>Nor will theſe miſchiefs ever bee ſtopped, till there bee Commiſsions by Act of Parlament according to former preſidents, when the Nation was defrauded of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as now it is, ſtrictly to enquire of the offendors, and bring them to Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>For of late, the eaſie eaſie of Delinquents for theſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hath given the boldneſs to offendors to go on: and Time, the trueſt School-maſter, hath taught all ages to know, that little penalties could yet never interpoſe betwixt the Merchant and his profit.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the Parlament, by their Ordinance 6 of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1647. did deſcrie all Clipped, Filed, or diminiſhed Monie (by means whereof great quantities were ſold to ſom Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths) who have made it a Trade to deal with Receivers of Publick Caſhes, Graſiers, and ſeveral other perſons (and in ſtead of melting of theſe Monies down) ſom Gold-ſmiths have iſſued theſe Monies out again in paiment, whereas at the Tower theſe Clipped Monies would make but five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Ounce Troie, theſe men have vented out theſe Clipped Monies to divers ill-affected people at five ſhillings ſix pence, and five ſhillings eight pence, and ſix ſhillings the Ounce, who have diſperſed the ſaid Clipped Monies ſo bought from Gold-ſmiths, up and down the Nation again, to the great enriching of themſelvs, and defrauding of the good people of this Nation, by buying up this Clipped Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119441:46"/> ſince the Ordinance 1647. at the leaſt twentie times over, and venting it for currant again, which had been helped, if there had been but ſix words put into the Ordinance, which was, to have required all perſons exchanging any Clipt, or uncurrant Engliſh monie with any Gold-ſmith or others, upon forfeiture of double the value, to ſee it cut in two pieces, or ſo defaced, that it ſhould not bee paſſable after. I humbly preſent this defect of that Ordinance, that it may bee looked after and amended; and I humbly deſire, that the Act againſt tranſporting Treaſure now committed, may bee enacted with ſuch vigor, that the Common-wealth may have the real benefit, and the offendors brought to exemplarie Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There hath been twentie Millions of Monie coined within this twentie five years, as will appear by the Mint-Books, and almost all of it tranſported out of the Nation, the Gold all gon, the currant Silver culled out, the weightieſt melted and tranſported: and that Silver-Monies which remain's is but little, and all culled Gold is made as pretious in this Common-wealth as Diamonds. What incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences will ariſe by the indirect dealing of private men in this particular to the Common-wealth, I ſhall humbly leav it to you to conſider.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Year 1643. It was humbly offered to this Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have the offendors diſcovered, and to bring them to Juſtice, and this miſchief ſtopped; but, by the great Intereſt of the offendors, that had then power in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Propoſition was ſlighted, and theſe miſchiefs ever ſince daily practiſed, to the unſpeakable damage of this Common-wealth: for it is far eaſier to keep the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Nation, by making ſtrict Laws againſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, then when it is gon to bring it back, as too late experience will make this Common-wealth feel. But you have the power to call theſe offendors to a ſtrict accompt, if you paſs the Act fully to enable all people to make their diſcoveries. <hi>How, and in what manner other Nations do puniſh theſe offendors, you have alreadie preſented out of their Placarts.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119441:47"/> This evil is grown to ſuch an hight, that both our own Laws put in the ſtricteſt execution, and the Cuſtoms and Laws of other Countries added to them for this particular, with the greateſt diligence of expert men, to make the ſearch for what is past, and to prevent theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs for the time to com, will bee little enough: and to make this diſcoverie is a ſervice of more Importance to the Common-wealth, then at firſt ſight can bee apprehended.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a certain rule, No great action in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or State, can bee don but by Monie, which all ages have held to bee the ſinews of War, and Garland of Peace; and what occaſions we have to uſe it both for commerce and ſafetie, is humbly left to you to conſider, and in all well-regulated States it hath ever been accompted a great ſervice to diſcover the offendors and abuſes practiſed upon the Treaſure of their Nation; and to prevent the growth of theſe miſchiefs, is the work of everie faithful lover of his Countrie; <hi>And hee or they that ſhall bee againſt the diſcoverie of theſe offences and offendors, may amongst judicious men bee juſtly ſuſpected to bee Parties themſelvs.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I humbly beſeech you to take notice, there hath been, within ſeven years Coined in ten daies, more Monie in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> then hath been Coined neer upon this three laſt years. Now if you ſuffer treaſure to go out of the Nation everie daie for want of a Law, to give all people power to diſcover and examine the offendors, in a ſhort time you will not have any Monie left in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For experience in all ages ſheweth, that little and ſlight penalties can never ſtop ſom Merchants from their profit: ſo they get to their private, they care not what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs the Common-wealth ſuffer's: <hi>For a Common-wealth without plentie of Monie, look's like a great Houſ unfurniſht; and bare Walls is no handſom ſight; and you will finde there will not bee Monie left to paie your juſt Taxes, Cuſtoms and Exciſe, and to maintain Trade and Commerce, if you clear not the obſtruction of the Mint, and take not ſom effectual courſ to ſet it on work. And this Act is but a preparation and ground work to cauſ your Mint to go; and till it paſs, you will never ſee your Mint flouriſh; for to allow any man to out-give the Mint for Bullion, is, to ſhut up the Mint; for all men will vent their treaſure, where they can have the greateſt price; and not to make a way for the opening of the Mint at this time, eſpecially when you have ſuch occaſions of monie;</hi> I ſhall humbly leav it to you to conſider the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

Upon this anſwer to the Committee, it put's mee in minde of a cuſtom, which is uſual in all men's houſes; <hi>If Glaſſes bee broke, or any other miſchief don, No bodie did it:</hi> But upon a Commiſſion of enquirie, many times it is found to bee <hi>Som. body.</hi> But to the queſtion that was asked the <hi>Gold-ſmith.</hi> by the Honorable Committee, concerning buying Gold and Silver above the price of the Mint, they pleaded, <hi>The Trade was an ancient Trade; that if they were reſtrained to a price, they, and their families could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist, that they could not buie Silver, but ſomtime the Market was at</hi> 5 s. 1 d. 5 s. 2d. <hi>and</hi> 5s. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If the Gold-ſmiths give <hi>5 s. 5 d.</hi> for this Sterling Silver, how can any bee brought into the Mint? nay, how is all the heavie Monie culled and melted down, and none left to paſs but light and clipped? And this is the true ground why many Gold-ſmiths are Caſhiers to Merchants, and keep ſervants to receiv men's Monies, without any reward, onely that they might cull, and weigh out the heavie Silver, and melt it or tranſport it beyond the Seas, for their own private gain, to the high deceit of the Nation.</p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119441:48"/>
                        <p>There is nothing in this Act doth reſtrain the due and orderly Trade of a Gold-ſmith, when in is well weighed and conſidered. But that which is their uſual Trade, now diſcovered to bee ſo highly deſtructive to the Nation, ought to bee reſtrained. The Bakers may as well Petition againſt all Pillories, or againſt my Lord Major, for weighing their Bread, as the Gold ſmiths juſtly except againſt the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, for giving for Gold and Silver, above the price of the Mint.</p>
                        <p>They ſee it, that it is the Law of the Land, in the 5 and 6 <hi>Ed. 6. cap. 13.</hi> It is the daily practice of <hi>France, Holland, Flanders,</hi> as appear's hereby their Laws. Clothing is the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land, and ought moſt to bee cheriſhed; yet the law propound's for the regulating of the weight, the length, and breadth. Brick-makers, Wood-mongers, Meal-men. and divers other Trades, are reſtrained and regulated, and yet all theſe Trades receiv protection and countenance in their orderly working of their Manufactures, from the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>There are people which believ, That if there had been a real intention to give a ſtop to the tranſporting of Monie, it had been don before; though for my part I am not of that opinion. <hi>There was</hi> (ſaie they) <hi>notice of it nine years ago, when the Presbyterie had the power:</hi> And ſeven years ago, the grievances of the Tranſporting of Gold and Silver, with ſeveral other abuſes, was by mee at large preſented to the Parlament, and the ſame miſchiefs foretold, which are now com to paſs; that without it were looked after, and a ſtrict Law made againſt it, to diſcover the offendors, there would not bee any Gold or Silver left in the Nation. And this hath proved too true; for many millions of Gold and Silver have ſince been tranſported, to the unſpeakable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>And upon ſeizure of ſeveral great quantities of Gold and Silver, by M. <hi>Watkins,</hi> chief Searcher of the Port of <hi>London,</hi> which was ſhipped to bee tranſported; the Order of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119441:49"/> Parlament, the 1 of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1647. was made to the Committee of the Navie, to ſee to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>After all theſe Certificates made by the Officers of the Mint and Cuſtoms, and the Committee of the Navie, for the ſpeedie putting ſo good a work in execution, (all which, I have hereafter ſet down.) The Council of State was pleaſed to make a Committee of themſelvs; and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and ſerious conſultations, drew up the draught of an Act of Parlament, with their deſire to the Parlament to have it paſs with all expedition, for the ſervice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                        <p>There are others, more unhappie, which ſaie, <hi>Now the Steed is ſtoln, ſhut the ſtable door:</hi> Now there is no more Gold left to tranſport, to what purpoſe doth the Parlament make an Act againſt tranſporting Gold? this ſhould have been don before; for how can wee maintain Commerce, paie Taxes, when our Engliſh Gold is fortie times more plentiful beyond the Seas, then it is in <hi>England,</hi> and almoſt all the Silver Coin of the Nation tranſported, and ſcarce any left, but clipped, and light monie.</p>
                        <p>And ſom people are ſo impudent to believ, that there are ſom Members of Parlament guiltie of tranſporting monie, or elſ this Act ſhould not have ſtuck ſo long upon their hands.</p>
                        <p>Others there are, that have tranſported monie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted manie abuſes upon the Coins of the Nation, that hope they ſhall have their pardon for what is paſt, though they have tranſported almoſt all the Gold and Silver of the Nation, that now if they would, they can offend no more; and they have don the Common-wealth that damage, that a Million of monie cannot give them ſatisfaction. Theſe I humbly conceiv, ought to bee made to reſtore their unjuſt gain, which will deter any others hereafter from doing the like.</p>
                        <p>And there are that ſaie, <hi>Look how almost all men have sped, that have certified againſt tranſporting monie, or lookt to ſtop the ſame.</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:119441:49"/> Hath not Sir <hi>Robert Harlow,</hi> and M. <hi>Cogan</hi> been put out of their places in the Mint?

                        <p>I ſhall add ſomthing more to this.

                        <p>The old Officers of the Mint, were Maſters in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, which is not ſo ſoon learned as men think. And for ſon of thoſe that have been turned out of their places out of the Cuſtom-Houſ, now the Act is paſſed for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trade, there will quickly bee preſented the practices of ſom of the Officers of the Cuſtoms, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for a redreſs of many abuſes practiſed by ſom of them, and a Review Petitioned for, to know upon what grounds many of the old Officers were turned out of their places, beeing never charged with any offence, but onely forced out to make waie for others to com into their places; ſom of the old Officers of the Cuſtoms beeing turned out of their places, onely becauſ of their activitie in ſtopping the Gold and Silver of the Nation from beeing tranſported;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119441:50"/> and this is M. <hi>Edward Watkins</hi> his caſe, and others put into his Office, that ſeize's Gold and Silver before it is forfeited, and when the Merchant recover's it again by Law, the Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that made the ſeizure, take's the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and ſo the Merchant may go ſeek his monie, to the great damage of the Merchant.</p>
                        <p>But according to the former preſidents, all Officers of the Cuſtoms were to put in ſecuritie for the juſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their truſt to the State, and no Officer was to receiv the Cuſtoms, and Monies of the Common-wealth in any Port of this Nation; nor to make any ſeizure before hee had put in ſecuritie to the Lord Treaſurer, to make a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what monies and goods came to their hands, which I (having more then probable reaſons) do believ the Collectors, and other Officers of the Ports, have not don, to the great damage of the Common-wealth, and prejudice of the Merchants, if ſeizures bee unjuſtly made, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants recover their Goods or Monies by a Verdict at Law, and after all their charge and hazard, not to have all their Goods and Monies again. This diſcoverie I have put in for the ſervice of the Common-wealth, it beeing a cauſ judged in the <hi>Checquer</hi> this laſt Term, that for the future ſuch abuſes of the new Officers of the Cuſtoms might bee prevented.</p>
                        <p>I have to ſom men replied this Act; it hath been delaied by the Parlament, onely by the multitude of other buſineſs, though I muſt confeſs there are verie few buſineſſes of the Common-wealth can take place before this, but that all people ſhould ſee when the Parlament's buſineſs was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over, how zealous in deeds, &amp; not in words, they would bee, for to puniſh theſe great offendors, and to make them paic back the unjuſt gain; which monies ſhould bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied for the Publick, and ſo ſave the Nation Taxes: That I was confident there was not any Member in the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was guiltie of tranſporting monie; or if there were, they durſt not bee ſeen to juſtifie ſo wicked an Act, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119441:50"/> would bee glad to ſleep quiet in a whole skin; and truly if I did know any of them, I would not meddle with them, unleſs the Act did poſitively enjoin mee to do it.</p>
                        <p>It hath been objected to mee, by ſom Gold-ſmiths, and others; <hi>That I my ſelf have been a tranſporter of monie, and melter down of heavie Coin of the Nation, and a furniſher of Gold and Silver to tranſport out of this Nation, and a buier of Gold and Silver above the price of the Mint.</hi> I denie it not, and my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them is, <hi>An old Dear-ſtealer is the best keeper of a Park.</hi> And though I had the late King's pardon, I had it not but it coſt mee dear; I paid at one time to his Privie Purſ, two thouſand twentie ſhillings Pieces in Gold, and I am out at this daie by his command, in making the diſcoverie of ſuch as tranſported Gold, nineteen hundred &amp; threeſcore pounds; both which ſummes, I have been out of Purſ fifteen years: I would not have the greateſt offendor (that is a Gold-ſmith) by my conſent, paie ſo great a ſumme. And this is my anſwer to them, to that objection.</p>
                        <p>I would have them by my example leav off ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive a Trade to the Common-wealth, as furniſhing the tranſporters with Gold and Silver, culling and melting down the currant Coin. If I had not been convinced in my conſcience, that it was bad, I would have followed that trade ſtill. I had as good an Eſtate, as moſt of the Gold-ſmiths to do it. I had as good credit, and I left my trade as fairly; for I challenge all, or any man in <hi>London,</hi> that can ſaie I did not paie all men readie monie to everie pennie and farthing I ought, when I gave over my trade; and the beſt Alderman of <hi>London</hi> can do no more. It is incident to all men to err; happie is hee that repent's; but to perſiſt againſt the light of a man's conſcience, is don by the ſtrong inſtigation of the Devil.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly preſent further, that there have great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs happened to this Nation and their Armie in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince this Parlament, by the indirect dealing of ſom Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Gold-ſmiths in <hi>London,</hi> who contracted with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119441:51"/> ſom of the adventurers for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſell them Rials of Eight and Forrain Coins, giving them ſom ſmall time; but the poor Soldiers that received theſe monies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> loſt above twentie pounds in the hundred by the monies ſo paid them; for firſt, the Gold-ſmiths culled out all the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and delivered none but light and clipped; and then the courſneſs of the Silver, which was Bead-monie, and adulterated in the Weſt-<hi>Indies</hi> in the Mints, ſomtimes ſix pence, ſomtimes more upon everie piece of Eight, as is well known to ſom Gold-ſmiths and Merchants, ſo that by the baſeneſs of the Allaie, and want of Weight there hath been at the leaſt twentie pounds in the hundred loſs to the ſoldiers, if hee would make any return of it to his wife or children in <hi>England,</hi> as many of them found by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                        <p>The Gold-ſmiths are the general Caſhiers, for ſom of the principal Merchants in the Citie; and this rule the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths obſerv; when they receiv monies, to take none that is bad or clipped, (but let any man ſend to them to receiv monies, they ſhall have great quantities of clipped monie mixed in their monies they receiv, and ſom of it conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will eſcape the teller's eies) which clipped monies the Gold-ſmiths buie of ſeveral people for Bullion, but never Coin it; the reſt that they cannot put off here in <hi>London,</hi> they have their Agents to vent it to Graſiers and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Countrie all over the Nation; by which means in many Towns and Cities of this Nation, they are ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred with clipped monie, that there is little elſ ſtirring in paiment, to the unſpeakable damage of the receiver, who cannot paie it in <hi>London,</hi> but ſell it to the Gold-ſmiths, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at twentie five, and thirtie in the hundred abated: which is by the Gold-ſmiths returned down into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie next week after; So that this abuſe is like an Horſ in a Mill, it turn's round, and is a cheat put upon all people of the Nation, and without a ſtrict Act of Parlament againſt it, will not bee prevented.</p>

                        <p>All theſe abuſes aforeſaid, are ſo high and tranſcendent, that the offendors ought to bee uſed as men uſually uſe Wolvs and Foxes; for if private murther bee ſo penal, much more is publick murther: now Monie is the Life, Bloud, and Soul of the Common-wealth, without it no great action can bee undertaken, for the ſervice of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thoſe that tranſport it, or adulterate it in weight, may well bee eſteemed as the greateſt enemies to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

                        <p>THeſe Gentlemen by reaſon of their places in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſ, and Mint within the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119441:54"/> their long experience in Merchandize and Trade of this Nation; I humbly conceiv their Certificates will leav a great Impreſsion upon the Parlament, and on the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Committeee that are appointed to report this Act, that what theſe Gentlemen have certified, hath been don upon a great deal of conſideration, and upon great experience, with all their beſt skill and judgment for the ſervice of this Nation in this moſt weightie buſineſs, it tending ſo highly to the ſafetie and welfare of the publick, and the delaie of paſsing this Act in its full force and vigor will one daie bee found to bee highly deſtructive to this Nation, and that the deſign hath been ſet on foot, and proſecuted to hinder the Act from paſsing, is don by ſom people that have made themſelvs fortunes by theſe wicked practices; and though they dare not ſpeak againſt the Act, yet they labor to ſtop it and delaie it, or to procure the altering of it, that it may bee uneffectual, to give a ſtop to theſe miſchiefs which I hope they ſhall never bee able to effect; I would have theſe men to know, Juſtice is ſlow, but it is ſure, and I am aſſured they will bee diſcovered and brought to Juſtice when they leaſt think of it; <hi>forbearance will bee no paiment:</hi> and this Act will bring their dark actions to light when it is paſſed the Houſ. Beſides theſe former Certificates, the Act now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted was drawn up by a Committee of the Council of State, and I was required to attend the Right Honorable Sir <hi>James Harrington</hi> in <hi>Januarie</hi> laſt, beeing one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for taking away the obſtructions of the Mint, which I did accordingly, and thereupon by Order of the Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Committee, for removing of the obſtruction of the Mint, I was deſired to ſend into <hi>Holland</hi> for ſeveral Coins of Forrain Gold and Silver, and ſeveral <hi>Placarts</hi> and Weights, and ſom of the ſaid Gold and Silver, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Doctor <hi>Gurden</hi> to make Aſſaies of, for the ſervice of the State, the remainder I have readie to deliver to any that will ſee mee paid upon the deliverie; I having deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded monie of Doctor <hi>Gurden</hi> divers times, who tell's mee,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119441:54"/> hee will procure monie, but hath not as yet paid mee for what I delivered him: and if I ſhould not bee paid for the Gold and Silver I writ for from <hi>Holland,</hi> the ſame price as by my friend I paid for it in the Bank in <hi>Holland,</hi> there would bee a great loſs redound to mee to Coin it here, and loſe the Exchange; the Exchange from <hi>Holland,</hi> when I writ for theſe Species, running at about thirtie two ſhillings <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do humbly deſire the Honorable Committee for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Mint, to call to the old Clerks of the Mint, for an accompt of what they have don about the Aſſaies made of Forrain Coins; and I humbly deſire you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how much it were for the ſervice of the Nation, both in point of honor, profit, and ſafetie, to ſet your Mint on work.</p>
                        <p>Which upon the peril of my life, if you paſs the Act, as it is recommended from the Council of State, I will finde out waies to ſet your Mint preſently a going, or loſe both my Eſtate and Life. I would not make this proffer, but that I am ſure of it; it is well known to all the Officers of the Mint, I know as much of Mint-buſineſs, as any of them here do; and for the Gold-ſmiths, I am ſure, they think I know too much: and the Merchants have found it, that I know what many did, and do here, and what their Factors did and do beyond Seas; and to bee Maſter of this ſecret, coſt mee many an hundred pound, beſides many years time and pains; and by my intelligence in the Sea-Ports of this Nation, I have cauſed the tranſporters of monie to bee fined at four and twentie thouſand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. And now as I have laid this buſineſs, they ſhall bee diſcovered all over this Nation. If I ſhould offer this, and could do the like ſervice in any other State, I humbly conceiv I need not Petition twice, but it would bee accepted at the firſt time; and the delaie of paſsing this Act, move's mee not at all for my own particular, but for the Common-wealth. I ſhall never forget Sir <hi>John Coke</hi>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:119441:55"/> his rule to mee, and hee was Secretarie of State to the late King, <hi>That hee never knew a patient and a vigilant man loſe his buſineſs, if it were just; for at one time or another, that man will finde an opportunitie to do it;</hi> and truly, by obſerving this rule, I have paſſed through great buſineſs, and ſom of much difficultie; for all which, I humbly thank God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to his mercie.</p>
                        <p>THere is another cauſ of the great waſte of the Treaſure of the Nation, which is the great quantitie of <hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, and <hi>French</hi> Laces, both in the Thread, and in Silk, which are imported into this Nation, to the value of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcores of thouſand pounds a year, which Lace is ſtoln in without paying any Cuſtom, beeing ſubtilly packed in commodities of great Bulk.</p>
                        <p>But what the State loſe's by the Cuſtom, is nothing in compariſon to what it loſe's in Stock; for the returns of this Lace is for the moſt part ſent over in Gold and Silver of the currant Coins of this Nation.</p>
                        <p>Neither is this miſchief all the hurt that cometh to the Common-wealth; for this Lace is made by them in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that can afford it far cheaper then any of our poor can do here; for generally it is made in Religious Houſes, in their Nunneries; which Nuns, generally bring into the Religious Houſes their Dowries when they are admitted, and as long they live, they are well provided for all manner of neceſſaries to live verie handſomly, both for their diet and apparel, beeing left to their voluntarie choice after their religious Exerciſes is don, to ſpend their time as they pleaſ.</p>
                        <p>Now many of them beeing excellent Needle-women, ſpend their time in making Cut-works, for their Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths, Black Laces for Scarffs, and <hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, (as they are called) though many of them are made in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe the Nuns make, and ſell great quantities of them into <hi>England;</hi> which monie is all returned into the uſe of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119441:55"/> the Monaſteries, theſe Nuns thinking they merit moſt, that can get their Monaſteries moſt monie by their labor.</p>
                        <p>And truly when I have been in companie of ſom fine Dames in <hi>London,</hi> that profeſs much; I have told them of their Laces and Gorgets, that if they did know whom they made rich by ſuch vanities, they would laie by the faſhion, and give that monie, they ſpent in <hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, to the poor, and not bee inſtruments of making Nuns and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries rich beyond Seas; and I have deſired them to think how contrarie their work was to their Husbands: their Husbands are deſtroying Biſhop's Houſes and Lands, and Deans and Chapter's Houſes, and Lands, here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> beeing Reliques of Poperie; and their Wives by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Nun's Laces in <hi>England,</hi> with the Returns of that Monie, which they produce here, are a building Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and Religious Houſes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I humbly deſire all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentrie, that are wearers of Lace, both Men and Women, to conſider ſeriouſly what I ſaie; it is of concernment. I take God to witneſs, I have heard <hi>French men,</hi> and <hi>Dutch men,</hi> ſaie to mee, above twelv years ago, that have dealt in Cut-work Laces, and in <hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, both black and white here in <hi>London,</hi> that they did believ there was above five hundred thouſand pounds in a year tranſported in Gold and Silver into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> onely in Return of Forrain Cut-works, and <hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, both Black and White; and I believ in my conſcience they ſpoke truth; and to this daie there are extreme exceſſes in theſe vanities; which as your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Common-wealth ſtand, highly concern you to look to prevent it; for I humbly deſire you to conſider, the Nation fling's away ſo much ſtock in monie; for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Lace is of no uſe but to keep up pride and vanities; Gold and Silver Lace make's ſomthing upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, one hundred pounds worth may make about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pounds when you have don wearing of it: But for thread &amp; ſilk Laces, that which coſt one hundred thouſand
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119441:56"/> pound, when they are worn out, will not make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth one pennie.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly deſire you to conſider of a ſtrict Law againſt importing any Forrain Laces, or ſelling them in <hi>London;</hi> the forfeiture of the Laces is nothing, becauſ it will not bee diſcovered, once in one thouſand times. But I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceiv, it muſt bee made Felonie for any to import <hi>Flanders, French,</hi> or Forrain Laces, or Cut-works, and loſs of any Shop-keeper's Eſtate that ſhall knowingly ſell any Forrain Laces, either <hi>Flanders,</hi> or any other.</p>
                        <p>By which means you will prevent the tranſporting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred thouſand pounds of treaſure in a year, and you will ſtop the trade of making Nunneries rich by our monie; And if the Gentrie will wear Laces, let them on God's name put our own poor on work, and not Forrainers; and by this means, you will give relief to many poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, which through the calamities of the War, are almoſt ſtarved, and they are aſhamed to beg, and they would bee glad to make Lace, if any would emploie them.</p>
                        <p>THere is alſo a great and exceſſive waſte of the Gold of this Nation, in the vanitie of guilding of <hi>Caroches,</hi> which is com to that extravagancie, that if a <hi>Bainian</hi> of the Faſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> or a <hi>Chinoes</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> or any other ſtrange Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould com to <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> in an after-noon, hee would report in his own Countrie ſuch ſtories, as your Jeſuits report of <hi>Perue,</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> upon the firſt diſcoverie of the Weſt-<hi>Indies; That there were Towns that all the houſes were covered over with Gold and Silver:</hi> So would an <hi>Indian</hi> report the Gentrie's wealth of this Nation; <hi>That they were drawn through the ſtreets of this Citie of</hi> London, <hi>in Caroches covered over with beaten Gold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I ſhall tell you what a <hi>French Merchant</hi> ſaid to mee this Summer in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> as wee were talking of the great quantities of Engliſh Gold, which hath been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other Forrain parts;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119441:56"/> Saith the <hi>French Merchant</hi> to mee, <hi>I have heard you often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of all the Engliſh Gold, beeing tranſported beyond the Seas, and now wee are again ſpeaking of it, I will demonſtrate to you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that all is not gon, for you ſee how many guilded Caroches here are;</hi> then laughing, hee told mee, <hi>you ſee Sir, how you are miſtaken, all your Gold is not gon; but if you had ſaid, almoſt all the Engliſh Gold is tranſported beyond the Seas, that I would have granted you, for you have the ſhell of the Gold to guild your Caroches, and to make you fine things, but wee in</hi> France <hi>have the kernel of your Gold, and thus much I grant you. But wee in</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>and</hi> Flanders, <hi>have not all, wee are more conſcionable, good Monſieur</hi> Violet. I was forced to bite my lip, for I could not denie but that hee ſpake truth.</p>
                        <p>THere is another great waſte of Gold and Silver in this Common-wealth, and that is, the making of Gold and Silver-Thread and Lace within this Nation: there are ſom things may bee ſaid for it, and ſom things againſt it; I ſhall impartially put down ſom things which I know in this buſineſs; for I had the principal care of regulating that Manufacture of Gold and Silver-Wier and Thread, for five years together in the late King's time, and paid him about four thouſand pounds yearly for it; beſides I was enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look to the juſt ſtandard of the Silver, and to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial making of the Manufacture, which now is totally neglected, and the Common-wealth cheated in the courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of much of the Silver, and in the ſlight making of it.</p>
                        <p>If the Manufacture of the Gold and Silver-Thread, was brought in from beyond the Seas, then would the State have the Cuſtom, there beeing a great Impoſt and Cuſtom laid on it, which would bee a conſiderable Revenue to the Common-wealth. The Common-wealth in the ſtock of their treaſure would bee augmented; for all Gold and Silver-Thread make's a Return to the melting pot, and ſo increaſe's the ſtock of monie in the Nation; beſides, that is an advantageous Trade, which for the Returns of our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119441:57"/> Commodities and Manufactures of <hi>England,</hi> bring's us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Silver.</p>
                        <p>There is replied to this, the ſetting ſo many thouſands of poor people on work, which will ſtarv, if the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Gold and Silver-Thread, were brought in from beyond the Seas, or if the State ſhould prohibit the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gold and Silver-Thread and Lace. Indeed this is of great conſideration, and ought to bee conſidered on. But then if they will have leav to make it here, it ſhould bee don with ſuch reſtraints and limitations, as the treaſure of the Nation ſhould not bee waſted or impaired, the currant monie of the Nation ſhould not bee culled out to make Gold and Silver-Thread, as many hundreds of thouſand pounds have been ſince the making of this Manufacture, which was but begun to bee a Trade in <hi>London,</hi> within leſs then fortie years; alſo there ſhould bee a reſtriction of the number of the workers, not to encreaſ as they have don, and the Wier-drawers ſhould bee a diſtinct Corporation, and Officers appointed to look after their due and Orderly working, and an accompt kept for the State, of what Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold is ſpent everie year in the Manufacture, and the Companie of Gold-Wier-drawers enjoined to bring in the value in Bullion from beyond the Seas, as they waſte in this Manufacture; for without doing of this, the trade is wholly deſtructive to the Common-wealth, and there can bee no juſt plea to allow their trade to continue.</p>
                        <p>I humbly conceiv the Common-wealth is not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſuffer fiftie thouſand pounds a year in Silver, to bee bruſhed and blown away out of Gold and Silver Lace: If thoſe that work the Manufacture, will not ſee to Import Silver from beyond the Seas, and bee bound not to work Silver with a Core of Copper, and ſell it for good Silver, (for which cheat I have cauſed ſom of them to ſtand in the Pillorie, when I had the managing of that Manufacture) and alſo that the Wier-drawers bee bound, not to make any Spangles, Wier, or Thread, under ſterling, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119441:57"/> hath been their daily practice, and I believ is continued ſtill. Therefore ought by a ſworn Officer to bee regulated, and that Officer to bee no Trader in the Manufacture.</p>
                        <p>M. <hi>Jackſon</hi> the Aſſaie-Maſter of Gold ſmith's Hall, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lords of the Council, made many ſcore of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies of Gold and Silver-Spangles, Lace, Wier, and Thread, found and taken in Silk-men's ſhops, which were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and under the Standard; and this Manufacture will never bee juſtly made, if there bee not a government ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by a Corporation, and then the Trade might bee ſo managed by their contracting for Bullion from beyond the Seas, that they may get a great Manufacture here. But I humbly deſire that Trade may bee driven with Forrain Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; Imported, and not with the Stock, or Coin of the Nation.</p>

                                    <head>In obedience to your Honor's Order, directed unto mee 29 <hi>November,</hi> 1650 concerning the Hand-Spinners of Gold and Silver-Thread, I humbly offer to your grave conſiderations theſe few Propoſitions, for the ſervice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</head>
                                    <p n="1">I. THat it bee not lawful for any perſon, either Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer, Weaver, or others, to keep any Wheels for the ſpinning of Gold or Silver-Thread, but within the Lines of Communication of <hi>London;</hi> and every perſon uſing ſuch Wheels, to give in their names, and their abiding places, and how many Wheels they keep, and their ſeveral working places, and a ſworn Officer appointed, who by himſelf and his ſufficient Deputies, to view and examine both the Sizes, the Silver ſo ſpun, and the fineneſs, and to deface and burn all under the Standard.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. That no Wheel bee admitted to ſpin Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Thread, but onely ſuperfine, and all other ſorts and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, to bee ſpun with, and by the Hand-ſpinners; and ſom ſtrict penaltie put on the offendors: for if you keep not a ſworn Officer that is no Trader in it, and do not reſtrain the offendors by a penaltie, there will bee no keeping theſe men within a rule: for few Laws well executed, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a multitude of Laws, and none to look after the execution of them. And if this Regulation ſhall bee left to the Wier-drawers (onely) they beeing parties, and their own profit concerned in it, the Common-wealth will ſtill bee deceived; for <hi>where the Felon make's the Hue and Crie, the Thief will never bee found.</hi> I humbly conceiv, the Wier-drawers may do well in having an equal power with the ſworn Surveior, to finde out the frauds in the Trade, but not to leav it wholly to them to finde out; for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119441:58"/> if you do, I humbly conceiv the Common-wealth will have no benefit, but a miſchief, as it is in ſom other Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which have ſuch privileges, that the Members of them are impowered to oppreſs and circumvent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the Nation, and to enrich themſelvs and their private intereſt, to the great damage of the publick. The Regulation of which is left to your Honors in the ninth Article of your Commiſsion.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. That no Gold-Wier-drawer bee admitted to make Gold and Silver Lace, nor Silver-Ribbon, nor no Weaver to make Gold and Silver-Thread, but either Trade tied to his own Art onely; for by the means of blending theſe two Trades together, all the bad and ſlight Stuff is foiſted into the Lace, and ſo cunningly interwoven, interwoven, that Artiſts themſelvs cannot diſcern it, when it is made into Lace; and by this ſlight of blending two Trades together, they put into their Silver-Ribbon, much Gold and Silver-Thread, made by the Wheel; ſom hold's not three Ounces Silver in a pound Venice, which is eight Ounces and four Drams Troie, whereas according to the rule of Merchantable Gold and Silver-Thread, there ſhould bee five Ounces of Silver at the leaſt to three Ounces Silk; a cheat that ought to bee puniſhed with the higheſt penalties; to couzen the buier of two Ounces in eight Ounces of Silver, and to make them paie for Silver, when the buier hath nothing but Silk, and that many times heavie died, which cauſeth the color of the Gold to tarniſh; and if the late King's Commiſſioners Books of Orders for the regulating of Gold and Silver-Thread, were returned out of the Parlament Houſ to this Council, there it will bee found the Wheels were upon ſeveral great complaints of the many abuſes thereof totally ſuppreſſed. And it was don upon ſerious deliberation, and much debate before the late King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at Law, and the Commiſsioners; and this can bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bee true by the Oaths of many people, and I will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119441:59"/> depoſe it, if I bee required by this Honorable Council.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The poor Women-ſpinners by the hand ſpindle, are diſcouraged from ſpeaking truth by many of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, or to move for a Regulation of the abuſes of their Trade, and dare not ſpeak againſt the ſaid abuſes, left they ſhould bee turned out of their work, as thoſe poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpinners are, that your Honors commanded to agitate for the whole Companie of Hand-ſpinners. And ſom of theſe poor Women-ſpinners, beſides turning out of their work, have been beaten and abuſed by their tyrannous work-maſters, and reviled with baſe and odious names by ſom of the Maſter Wier-drawers; and this is the true reaſon why the work-men are retarded, that they do not com and join with the women, and ſhew their juſt grievances, and the many abuſes daily practiſed in their Trade, whereby the Common-wealth is, and hath been ſo groſly abuſed, and the poor work-men and women oppreſſed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the poor Hand-ſpinners had not opened ſom of the abuſes of the Trade to your Honors, neither Work-maſter, Finer, nor Work-man, would have put to their hand for a Regulation. And this I believ in my conſcience to bee true.</p>
                                    <p>May it pleaſ your Honors, the greateſt part of the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinner's work is fine five-bourn, and the greateſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the poor Petitioners are fine five-bourn-ſpinners; ſom of the Wier-drawers are utterly againſt the Wheels for any ſort of work, and many of them for ſuperfine, if they durſt ſpeak it: But they all beeing parties, I moſt humbly leav it to your Wiſdoms to take notice, that their ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt make's many of them ſpeak that with their mouths, which in my conſcience their hearts know they ſpeak not the truth in this particular. And as I humbly conceiv, if that the Wheels bee not ſtrictly tied up onely to ſuperfine, many of the Hand-ſpinners will periſh for want of bread: and this I ſpeak, I believ in my conſcience is a truth; and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119441:59"/> therefore I do moſt humbly leav it to your Honor's pious and charitable conſideration.</p>
                                    <p>That if your Honors would have a ſpeedie Reformation in this Trade, I humbly conceiv, that if any Wier-drawer, Weaver, or others, that make Silver-Thread, or Wier, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then the Standard, or ſpin on the Wheels any other ſort of Silver-Thread, then ſuch as ſhall bee appointed by your Honors; and any other perſons that ſhall make any Gold or Silver-Thread, not holding at the leaſt five Ounces Troie upon everie pound weight Venice, which is eight Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and one fift Troie; that ſtrict puniſhments may bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and inflicted on the offendors; and upon the third time of conviction, beſides the loſs of the Materials, to bee further puniſhed, either by beeing diſ-franchiſed for a time, or for ever, as to your Honor's ſhall ſeem moſt agreeable to Juſtice. And that a ſworn Officer bee appointed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of his skill, to ſee to make it his buſineſs to go from place to place amongſt all the workers of the Manufactures, to ſee the workers make all fine Silver, and everie ſort of this Manufacture to bee according to the rules ſettled by your Honors. Many other things I could enlarge my ſelf in concerning this Trade, but ſhall reſpite them for the preſent; and humbly ſubmit my ſelf, and all that I have here ſaid to your Honor's grave conſideration.</p>

                        <p>WHereas the Gold-Wier-drawers and Refiners of <hi>London,</hi> have preſented to the Honorable Council for Trade, the draught of a Corporation, as it is deſired by them, it is utterly deſtructive to the Common-wealth; and I do moſt humbly deſire the Honorable Council for Trade, to take notice that ſom of the Gold-Wier-drawers of <hi>London,</hi> in the behalf of themſelvs, and divers other Wier-drawers of <hi>London,</hi> did Petition the late King for a Corporation, in <hi>March</hi> 1634. and in <hi>April</hi> 1635. confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the many abuſes practiſed in the managing of the ſame Trade, which were then under no government; did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in their Petition, that by his Majeſtie's gracious care, they might bee reduced into Government, and made a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and that they might have one or two Refiners, ſuch as the Wier-drawers ſhould deem fit, to bee added to their Corporation, (and excluding all the reſt of the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) that were Houſ-keepers or Free-men, and onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs might ſolely have the Order and Government of the Trade, and the Regulation of the ſaid Manufacture.</p>
                        <p>And in conſideration of this, the Wier-drawers offered the late King for his favor in that behalf, to paie to him and his ſucceſſors, one thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and 2 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce for everie Ounce of ſuch Bullion and Forrain Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as they ſhould uſe in their ſaid Manufacture, over and above the currant price of the Merchants. And about the ſame time the Companie of Gold-ſmiths beeing at the late King's Council-Table, did there charge ſeveral abuſes and high miſdemeanors upon ſom of the Refiners of <hi>London,</hi> and other perſons, as will appear by the Council-Table-Books, and by the Records and Journal Books at Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's Hall, if one could com to the ſight of them; for it cannot bee imagined, the Companie of Gold-ſmiths would give ſo high a charge as they did againſt ſom of the Refiners, and ſom Gold-ſmiths, but they have the Charge recorded in their Books, which I humbly deſire the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119441:60"/> of Trade may have a Copie of, that ſo they might ſee the abuſes in the Trade of Refining and Wier-drawing, and who were the offendors; and no queſtion but the ſame abuſes are practiſed ſtill, if there were an examination, and power given to the Surveior of Gold and Silver-Thread, to finde them out. The truth is, that upon the complaint of the Gold-ſmith's Companie at the Council Table, of the ſeveral abuſes in the Trade of Refining and Wier-drawing, the Wier-drawers, conceiving the late King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel would put down the wearing and working of Gold and Silver-Wier, and Thread, and puniſh the offendors in Star-Chamber, and knowing what would move, and bee moſt taken in Court, I ſaie, the Wier-drawers voluntarily, and of their own accord, did com and petition, and made friends, that their Trade ſhould bee continued. And this Model was laid to have a Monopoly to ſom Wier-drawers, and Finers as aforeſaid; and in the purſuance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Wier-drawers, they had many meetings with Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Whitfield,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naël Tompkins,</hi> and divers others, where the whole drift was to exclude all the Refiners but one or two from their trades. And in conſideration thereof, that they would for this great grace and favor (their own words) paie two pence the Ounce, and one thouſand pounds a year to the late King. It is as true, that upon complaint of ſom of the Gold-ſmiths, ſeveral Refiners and Gold-ſmiths were proceeded againſt in the Exchequer, and Star-Chamber, for melting down the currant Silver Coins of the Nation, for buying Gold and Silver above the price of the Mint, and for refining of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contrarie to a Statute made in <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeventh's time; and it is as true, that I <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was informed againſt in the Star-Chamber and Exchequer, for all theſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and beeing to bee examined upon Interrogatories againſt my ſelf, both at the Council. Table and Star-Chamber, and before Maſter Atturnie <hi>Noie,</hi> and Maſter Atturnie <hi>Banks,</hi> I did refuſe to bee examined upon Interrogatories, ſuch
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119441:61"/> as Maſter Atturnie General had exhibited againſt mee in Star-Chamber; for I knew, if I had denied them, the Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie General could prove them on mee by ſom Gold-ſmiths and others, that had voluntarily confeſſed againſt mee, that I had tranſported Gold, and that I had melted the currant heavie Silver of this Nation, and that I had ſold Silver and Gold above the price of the Mint.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon that moſt Honorable Gentleman Sir <hi>John Coke,</hi> Secretarie of State, after that I had oftentimes been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at the Council-Table, and at the Star-Chamber Office, and for refuſing to anſwer to their queſtions, had ſuffered cloſe impriſonment for above 20 weeks, beeing cloſe priſoner to ſeveral Meſſengers, <hi>viz. Meaſie, Stockdal,</hi> and <hi>Barker,</hi> for all that time, to the loſs of my Trade, which was then greater then any Gold-ſmith's in <hi>London.</hi> I ſaie, that great Stateſ-man had a noble care of mee, and ſent for mee, ſhewed mee what was proved againſt mee, and withal a Warrant that hee had ſigned by Order of the late King, and his Privie Council, for Maſter Atturnie General to bring mee to the Star-Chamber-Bar, the next ſitting of the Court, and there to crave the Judgment of the Court againſt mee, his Charge beeing taken againſt mee <hi>pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereupon Secretarie <hi>Coke</hi> became a Petitioner to the late King, that before hee delivered Maſter Atturnie the Warrant, to proceed againſt mee, hee might ſend once again for mee; and hee told the late King, that hee was of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that when I ſaw my danger, and how I was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by thoſe that held mee fair in hand, and were the men that did betraie mee, I would bee ſo ingenuous to my ſelf, to keep mee from a ruine, to confeſs the truth, and all that I knew upon oath againſt thoſe that had diſcovered mee; and my ſo doing, would bee much for the ſervice of the State: and to this effect, when I ſpake with Secretarie <hi>Coke,</hi> was his Diſcourſ to mee, not giving mee a quarter of an hours time to return him my anſwer, nor ſuffering mee to go
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119441:61"/> out of his ſight. When I ſaw the Snare, I bleſt the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, (which was Sir <hi>John Coke)</hi> who had traverſed mee in <hi>France,</hi> (and intercepted my Letters, though not written to mee by name) knew a great part of my proceedings there, about my Tranſporting Gold, and hee had many Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths that hee ſent for, which confeſſed to him that week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had bought great quantities of Light Engliſh Gold of many Gold-ſmiths of <hi>London,</hi> and I was to bee forced to give an accompt what I did with it.</p>
                        <p>And ſom other of my Factors that I had dealt with in <hi>France,</hi> Sir <hi>John Coke</hi> had gotten them upon their coming over at <hi>Rie,</hi> and at <hi>Dover</hi> apprehended, and they confeſſed they did receiv Light Engliſh Gold of mee, and other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Gold and Silver in <hi>France.</hi> And all the papers that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered any thing againſt mee, hee ſhewed mee, and told mee my danger: When I ſaw it, I was aſtoniſhed, not imagining that any man did know my proceedings in this buſineſs, or that I was betraied by thoſe that ſpoke mee fair, and was as faultie as my ſelf; for if it were a crime in mee to buie this Light Gold, it was as great an one in the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths to ſell it; and if it were a crime in mee to tranſport Gold, it was as great a crime in Engliſh men to bee my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Partners, though at <hi>Roan, Calice, Deep,</hi> or <hi>Paris.</hi> And when I found theſe were the men that abuſed mee to currie favor, and to get their own diſcharge, I beſought God in my heart, ſo to direct mee, that I might overcom this Philiſtim; and I was an humble ſutor to Sir <hi>John Coke,</hi> to make my peace with the late King upon any terms, and that I might have the late King's pardon; and in humble requital, I would really diſcover to him what Tranſporters of Gold I knew, and what Gold-ſmiths I knew had ſold Gold and Silver above the price of the Mint, and Culled and Melted down the currant Monie of this Nation, and paie him two thouſand pounds in Gold to his Privie Purſ, which I did accordingly paie into his Privie Purſ, and had my pardon under the Great Seal.</p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:119441:62"/>
                        <p>And I was forced before I could get my pardon, to bring in all my Books and Accompts to Sir <hi>John Coke,</hi> and by them I proved that I had Imported into this Nation more Silver in value, then I had Exported Gold. By which Accompts, I made it clearly appear, that the benefit and advantage was to bee made by underſtanding the weight and fineneſs of all Forrain Coins, and what proportion their Silver hath to our Gold, and our Silver to their Gold; for this was the Accompt in <hi>France</hi> 1632, 1633, 1634. that all our Engliſh Gold whether Light or Weight, (for they went all at one price without weighing the twentie ſhillings piece) paſſed in currant paiment in <hi>France</hi> for twentie ſix ſhillings, and the Cardecu in <hi>France</hi> went then at 16 Sols, as all men know which were then in <hi>France;</hi> ſo that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, I made my reckoning 16 Sols in <hi>France,</hi> is 19 <hi>d. ob.</hi> Engliſh for everie Cardecu, what will theſe Cardecues make mee in <hi>London,</hi> beeing all full weight, ſix pennie weight Troie at the leaſt, which in the Mint in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>London</hi> would make 18 <hi>d.</hi> ſterling. By this accompt, I found there was above twentie in the hundred got by tranſporting our Engliſh Gold, and returning of heavie Cardecues, which then at thoſe times there was as much of them to bee had both at <hi>Calice, Paris, Roan,</hi> and <hi>Deep,</hi> amongſt the Bankers, as a man would deſire. Then for the moſt part the lightneſs of the Gold paid for the Portage, and a man might make his return once everie moneth, and I have don it ſomtimes in fourteen daies, and got above twentie in the hundred.</p>
                        <p>When the late King ſaw my Accompts in this manner made up for many thouſand pounds, hee commended my ingenuitie, but hee would ſhare ſtakes with mee a little; for hee commanded mee to bring him two thouſand pounds in Gold, and then I ſhould have my pardon; which I did verie willingly, and humbly thanked him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to mee.</p>
                        <p>But that which pleaſed the late King, and brought mee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119441:62"/> into his ſervice, was, when I ſhewed him ſeveral proceſſes atteſted out of <hi>France,</hi> under publick Notarie's hands, that ſom of thoſe French men that dealt with mee for Engliſh Gold, were ſued in the Parlament of <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſending out of <hi>France</hi> the heavie Cardecues at an under-value, and for bringing into <hi>France</hi> Engliſh Gold at a greater value. Much about this time, the refiners &amp; wier-drawer's buſineſs beeing under examination; the late King finding by what I before had declared, my skill in managing Mint-buſineſs, and the Bullion of this Nation, appointed mee to have the view and ſurveying of all the Manufacture of Gold and Silver-Wier, and Thread, and to confirm it to mee for three lives; the Grant coſt near fifteen hundred pounds, to the Lord Treaſurer, Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Maſter Secretarie <hi>Coke,</hi> and others; and I make no queſtion to ſhew the juſtneſs of the Grant to the Honorable Council of Trade, and what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it is to the Common-wealth to have mee reſtored to that office again, which all the while I had it, I cauſed the Manufacture all to bee juſtly made, and according to the Standard, and that there was never ſo good Gold and Silver, Thread made in the Common-wealth before I had the Office, nor ſince the Office was ſequeſtred from mee; and this I can prove by many people that are Artiſts in the Trade.</p>
                        <p>That a little before this time, upon the information of ſom of the Companie of Gold-ſmiths to the late King and his Council, a Commiſſion did iſſue out to make inquirie of the deceits and abuſes of the Refiners of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in tranſporting Gold and Silver; whereupon as I ſaid before, Sir <hi>John Wollaſton, Will. Gibs, Walter Hill, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Patrickſon,</hi> Refiners; <hi>Henrie Foot, John Perin, Timothie Eman, Tho. Violet,</hi> Gold-ſmiths, were made Defendants in the Star-Chamber. The Refiners had that good fortune, they all got off without a ſentence, by their wit, which was to out-bid the Wier-drawers; for the Wier-drawers bid as appear's but one thouſand pounds a year, and two pence an
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119441:63"/> Ounce, and a few humble words, <hi>viz. And the Corporation of Gold-Wier-drawers, for your Majeſtie's grace and goodneſs to them, in continuing their Trades, and reducing the ſame to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, humbly offer to paie to your Majeſtie, your heirs, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, for ever, one thouſand pounds a year, and two pence an Ounce, in lieu of your Cuſtoms, from</hi> Michaelmas <hi>next; and for and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Proviſion and Importation of ſuch Bullion as the Members of this Corporation ſhall uſe;</hi> and this was in <hi>March</hi> 1634. and in <hi>April</hi> 1635.</p>
                        <p>And thereupon Maſter Atturnie General had many trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Wier-drawers, and others, and modelled the draught of a Certificate; and truly I know not whether hee ever delivered it to the late King; but the pithineſs and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of it, will ſhew it muſt bee his: and that this Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate was made upon many arguments of all hands, and treatie with all parties; for Maſter Atturnie had drawn a Certificate fit for a King to look on, containing ſo much matter in ſo few words; and if the Honorable Council of Trade will bee pleaſed to conſider of this Certificate, they will finde a great part of the Regulation of the Trade ſettled in this Certificate, if they pleaſ to conſider of everie branch of it, for it is all matter of State.</p>

                        <p>Whereupon the Refiners, as Sir <hi>John Wollaſton,</hi> Maſter Alderman <hi>Gibs,</hi> and others, ſeeing the Wier-drawers go about to exclude them of their Trade, and to get a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the terms aforeſaid; they (I ſaie) did ſerv the Wier-drawers, as the Merchant-Adventurers ſerved the Cloth-workers, out-bid them; for they to have their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and to bee freed of the complaints of the Gold-ſmiths in the Star-Chamber, and to have the Trade onely in their own hands, that none but the Refiners of <hi>London</hi> might bee his Majeſtie's Agents in the new waie of Regulation, for the furniſhing, and preparing, fining, refining, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gold and Silver-Wier, to bee uſed and emploied in the Manufactures.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119441:64"/> everie Ounce of Silver guilt, ſix pence; and for everie Ounce of Gold, ſix pence; So that upon the finiſhing of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the late King and the Refiners, the Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers which would have excluded the Refiners from their Corporation, are by theſe Articles debarred their Trade; and both Gold-ſmiths, and Wier-drawers, or any other but theſe Agents, were debarred to prepare any Silver for any of the Manufactures of Wier-drawers; and becauſ they came off ſo freely, and bid the late King roundly ſix pence the Ounce on all the Wier, the late King was pleaſed to gratifie them with a Courtly title, calling them his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved ſubjects, the Refiners of <hi>London,</hi> his Agents; and to requite them, ſettled ſuch a price certain for fine Silver, and refine Silver, and ſuch a price certain for ordinary guilt, and rich guilt, and no perſon ſhould preſume to have or make any of theſe Materials, but to give theſe the late King's Agents their own price, and none to ſell, but theſe Refiners, lately created the late King's Agents.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon Captain <hi>Williams,</hi> the late King's Father's Gold-ſmith, in the behalf of the Companie of Gold-ſmiths, hee beeing one of the late King's Commiſsioners, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did deſire, that the Gold-ſmiths might bee heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Monopoly of the Refiners; and hee beeing a rich man, worth at leaſt fiftie thouſand pounds, did offer in the behalf of the Companie of Gold-ſmiths, to give any ſecuritie to the late King; that if the Trade were left open to a free Market for all the Gold-ſmiths as formerly, the Gold-ſmiths would ſell all the Silver to the Wier-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>London,</hi> in everie Ounce of guilt Silver-Wier, two pence, and in Silver-Wier one pennie cheaper, then the late King's Agents made them paie.</p>
                        <p>The like Propoſitions was made by <hi>Henrie Footer</hi> Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, then a man of great credit, and by <hi>William Simmonds</hi> Wier-drawer of <hi>London,</hi> and divers others, for a free Trade, that they might not bee reſtrained to buie their Silver of the Refiners of <hi>London</hi> onely, but to bee at libertie as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119441:65"/> to buie their Silver where they will, and to refine their own Silver.</p>
                        <p>But theſe offers after many diſputes, the Refiners oppoſed, and then ſaid it was their Trade, and none ſhould fine and prepare Gold and Silver for any Manufactures uſed by the Gold-Wier-drawers, but themſelvs, the late King's Agents, which was, as I take it, onely to eight Refiners of <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Wier-drawers ſeeing themſelvs over powered by theſe the late King's Agents, a little before the Parlament, and at the beginning of this Parlament, complained and clamored at the Regulation; when, if the Refiners had left the Market open for all men equally to prepare his own Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, paying the late King the duties, it is well known the Wier-drawers could never have hindered the ſealing and ſurveying of the Manufacture of Gold and Silver-Thread; for by that waie, the Manufacture was warranted to the Common-wealth: and if it had been continued, it would have avoided and prevented the many abuſes ſince, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſlight and courſ Silver-Thread, and Spangles, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And if I had had the managing of my Office, as I had formerly, the State ſhould have had twentie thouſand pounds in their Coffers for Exciſe, more then they have received within theſe four years, due to them upon four pence the Ounce Exciſe; which monie is in the hands of ſom of the Wier-drawers and Refiners.</p>
                        <p>Now when this buſines came to bee examined in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe Agents that would not before part with their Title, would not let the Gold-ſmiths have a free Market to prepare Silver for Gold and Silver-wier; would not ſuffer the Wier-drawers to prepare their own Silver, they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to paie the late King's duties in the Office. I ſaie, theſe Agents finding ſom of the Members in Parlament to reſent a reſtraint in Trade to a few Refiners, and knowing none but themſelvs guiltie of the offence, cunningly put in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition into the Parlament, the twentie fourth of <hi>November</hi> 1640. as though the prices allowed to them to ſell their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119441:65"/> Silver, and they onely to bee the Agents to ſell, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably put upon them, and againſt their wils; and if they ſhould not have furniſhed the Silver at the place appointed, and bee readie alwaies at fit and convenient times to ſell and utter the ſame to the perſons ſo allowed, deſiring to buie the ſame at the rates limited by their Indenture, but ſhould fail therein for the ſpace of eight daies. Then upon proof thereof before ſix of the Commiſsioners, whereof one ſhould bee of his Majeſtie's Privie Council, &amp; upon their Certificate his Majeſtie might give libertie to others to do the ſame; the conſequence whereof would have been to deprive the Refiners of their Trade.</p>
                        <p>This ſhew's clearly, if this Agencie had not been for their profit, and to make an advantage, the Refiners might have forfeited their Agencie everie eight daies. But they kept it up for their own profit; for if they had laid it down, the Companie of Gold-ſmiths, and the Wier-drawers, would have had a free Market, and the duties ſtill reſerved to the late King, would have been paid by the Wier-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Gold-ſmiths as was offered. And whereas they are ſo injurious to ſaie, that they were fettered with the late King's Covenants and Agents, I knew the time when they ſaid otherwiſe, and when ſom of them were moſt humble Petitioners to the late King for his mercie, which hee gave, at my Interceſſion freely, to ſom of them, and his pardon under the Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and that courteſie I did for them freely, without one pennie reward. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital to ſaie they were fettered with his Agencie; truly it was ſuch a fetter, that I upon my own knowledg do know both the Silk-men of <hi>London,</hi> the Wier-drawers of <hi>London,</hi> and the Gold-ſmiths of <hi>London,</hi> did oppoſe the reſtraining of the Trade of ſelling Gold and Silver-wier onely to the Refiners, and deſired to have a free Market; and ſom of them did offer to ſell it two pence in the Ounce in guilt-wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and one pennie the Ounce in Silver-wier cheaper then the late King's Agents, and to put in good ſecuritie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119441:66"/> the ſame to the Nation, and to paie the late King's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which at ſix pence the Ounce in Wier, is not above two pence the Ounce in Venice Gold and Silver-Thread.</p>
                        <p>This I can ſaie, what the Finers called a Fetter, would have been an Ornament, if the Wier-drawers had not complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them in Parlament, both for their title of the late King's Agents, and the many hundred pounds a year they received for their Silver, more then it was offered to bee ſold to the Wier-drawers at, by the perſons before named; and this I know to bee true.</p>
                        <p>That upon many daies examination of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by Maſter Atturnie General, and all the reſt of the late King's Council at Law, and before the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, it was unanimouſly upon many great and grave diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes carried, that the intruſting of the Regulation of this Manufacture of Gold and Silver-wier, and Thread, was not to bee don by waie of Corporation, neither to the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor Wier-drawers of <hi>London;</hi> and the principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That upon a trial of above one hundred ſeveral aſſaies of Gold &amp; Silver bought up in ſeveral Silk-men's, and Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer's ſhops, both of Spangles, plated wier, Gold and Silver-Thread, and made by Maſter <hi>Jackſon</hi> the Aſſaie-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Gold-ſmith's Hall; the Gold and Silver-Thread, Spangles, &amp; Wier, were found to bee made courſ and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, and under the ſterling; and I had all theſe Aſſaies atteſted under Maſter <hi>Jakſon's</hi> hand, the Aſſaie-Maſter of Gold-ſmith's Hall; and for his pains in making theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies, I had order from the Lords of the Council, to paie Maſter <hi>Jackſon</hi> five pounds, which I did accordingly, and I delivered the Reports of theſe Aſſaies to the Lords of the Council; and Maſter <hi>Jackſon</hi> the Aſſaie-Maſter of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's Hall, cannot denie this to bee true.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It was proved that the Manufacture of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Thread, was ſlightly made, and not ſo ſubſtantial and ſerviceable as the Gold and Silver-Thread which was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119441:66"/> from <hi>Venice,</hi> and other Forrain parts; all of the Gold and Silver-Thread coming from <hi>Venice,</hi> holding two parts Silver, or within a verie little, as ſix Ounces Silver to three Ounces Silk.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thereupon a rule was ſet by the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil upon many debates, that no Gold and Silver-Thread ſhould bee made under five Ounces Silver, to three Ounces Silk at the leaſt; and for Needle Gold-Thread, according to the ſtandard of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſix Ounces Silver to three Ounces Silk.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That all the Gold and Silver-Thread Imported from beyond Seas, beeing of ſo ſtrong a plate, was made up in ſcanes, that ſo the buier might but turn it in his hand, and ſee it was all perfectly good; a great advantage to the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, to have it all juſtly made for the fineneſs of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and to have ſuch a bodie of Silver on the Silk, as it was ſerviceable to the Common-wealth; and when it was worn out, almoſt all returned into the melting pot for Bullion; and upon this reaſon the ſlight ſtuff was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was almoſt all waſted, and not a tenth part returned to the melting pot, to the waſte of the treaſure of the Nation, above fiftie thouſand pounds in a year.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Lords of the Council after many debates with the King's Council, and they with the Silk-men and Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers, ſet this rule for all the Manufactures of Gold and Silver-Thread, That it ſhould all bee made up in ſcanes, of about an Ounce weight, according to the commendable waie of <hi>Venice,</hi> which make's this Manufacture ſo juſtly both for the weight and fineneſs, that in one hundred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Venice</hi> Gold-Thread, there is not one ſix pence diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but according to the ſeals or burns, it paſſe's all the world over. A gallant thing to manage a Manufacture ſo exactly, and to keep up the reputation of it.</p>
                        <p>The late King and his Council appointed mee a Seal, which was the <hi>Roſe</hi> and <hi>Crown,</hi> to ſeal all Gold and Silver-Thread in ſcanes, at one end of the ſcane, and to warrant it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119441:67"/> to bee good Silver to the Nation, with a Prohibition to any to preſume to counterfeit that Seal: The other end of the ſcane of Silver-Thread, the work-man was to put to his ſeal; by which waie, the Nation had the Gold and Silver-Thread warranted to them, and if any Gold or Silver-thread were ſealed with the ſeal of the Office, and had the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſeal to it; which ſeal of the work-mans, was put in a Table in the Office for any man to ſee, by which means if any man ſhould have counterfeited the Office-ſeal, and the Thread was found courſer or worſer then the ſtandard, and not to have five Ounces to one pound <hi>Venice,</hi> the partie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending was to bee puniſhed; and if any Clerk of mine ſhould have ſealed any courſ Silver with the ſeal of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then I <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was to make it good to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or any partie grieved, what they were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; and to warrant this Manufacture right, both for to have five Ounces Silver on a pound <hi>Venice,</hi> and that to bee good Silver. I had no more then four pence the pound weight <hi>Venice</hi> for my pains and hazard, which was little more then one farthing an Ounce; and if any perſon did complain, then I <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> was to make all the damage good to the partie or parties grieved; and out of this fee I was to paie Clerk's wages and other Officers for their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in ſealing the Thread, and for wax for ſealing.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, it is no ſmall trouble to have daily converſation with people of ſuch ſeveral humors, and ſom of them of ſuch uncivil and courſ behavior, that the Honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Trade have had more patience to hear their ſpeeches one to another at the board, then I believ they ever had with any people that came before them; then they muſt needs bee clamorous when the Officer doth his dutie to ſee they make all good work; and this place I <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was required to execute. And I have the Grant of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for two lives; and though I was commanded to deliver my Patent to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Harlow,</hi> who was then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119441:67"/> of the Mint, and Chair-man for this buſineſs, but as yet hee hath not made any report concerning this buſineſs. I ſtand upon my Grant as a good Patent, and for the benefit of the Common-wealth; for the fee was not 10 <hi>s.</hi> in 100 pounds for all Gold and Silver Manufactured in Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, Silver-ſpangles, Oes, and Purl, and Wier, and for that fee I was to run the hazard to make all the Manufacture good to this Nation, that was bought in the Office, or had the ſeal appointed by the State put to the thread; and I ſhall humbly appeal to all the wearers of Gold and Silver-Lace in this Nation, whether they would not bee glad to paie ten ſhillings in the hundred pounds now, to have their Gold and Silver-thread, and wier warranted to them to bee good Silver, and the Silk truly covered with a ſubſtantial Bodie of Silver, and to the Thread everie pound <hi>Venice</hi> to weigh at the leaſt five Ounces of Silver, by which order and rule, their Silver-Lace would laſt ſix times as long as it doth, and never loſe the color; and when they had don wearing it, it would yield above one third pennie it coſt to the melting pot, whereas now upon ſom Silver-Lace that is made in <hi>London,</hi> when it is worn out, that Silver that coſt ten pounds, will not yield twentie ſhillings to the melting pot; and this is known by ſlight Wheel-work, and ſlight Laces; a great deal of difference upon the return to the melting pot, of rich Lace made by the Hand ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſlight Wheel-work made by your Wheel-men; and this can bee proved by many Tradeſ-men, as Tailors and Silk-men, and Silver-ſpinners, who are beſt able to judg the Manufacture, that the Gold and Silver-Thread, and Wier, was never ſo well made in <hi>England,</hi> before nor ſince, as during all the time I had the regulating of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture; and it did concern mee to look to have it well made, or elſ I might have been undon, for I was to make it all good. It was not to receiv a fee, and never to look how the Manufacture was made; but my fee was to bee earned with a great deal of attendance, and charge, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119441:68"/> hazard, and my conſtant ſearching to ſee the Manufacture was vvell made.</p>
                        <p>The Wier-drawers and Silk-men knew I would ſpare none of them that made bad ware; for I cauſed <hi>Gares</hi> to ſtand in the Pillorie, that made Gold and Silver-Thread vvith a Core of Copper; I cauſed ſlight vvork to bee unſpun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that was not covered vvith five Ounces Silver to one pound <hi>Venice;</hi> and this I did to <hi>Archer</hi> that was the Clerk of the Commiſsion, though hee brought mee a Letter from a Privie Counſellor, to deliver the Silver-Thread without defacing; yet I valued the keeping my truſt, before a Lord's Letter, and hee was no mean man in power then.</p>
                        <p>I queſtioned Maſter <hi>Bradbourn</hi> the Queen's Silk-man, for putting in Copper into an Honorable Ladie's Silver-Lace, and ſelling it her for good Silver; and a ſecond time for putting Copper into my Lord <hi>Carlile's</hi> Suit and Cloak, and ſelling it to him for good Silver; and if the Queen had not ſent to mee, and laid her commands on mee not to proceed farther, I had made him an example. Many other Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſold Silver-Thread with a Core of Copper, and ſom ſold Copper for Silver, vvhich as long as I had the Truſt, I vvould not ſpare any man.</p>
                        <p>I ſeized on fiftie pounds of Silver-Lace, mixed with Copper, in Maſter Alderman <hi>Garrawaie's</hi> cuſtodie, when hee was Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> and brought it away from him againſt his will, as Sir <hi>George Sands</hi> knoweth, and the vvorld know's hee had ſpirit enough: and upon that ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, I found twentie men had an hand in it, for it was ſent to <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> and there the Emperor's Council ſeized it, and laid Maſter <hi>Sands</hi> in priſon, Sir <hi>George Sand's</hi> brother, who had brought the adulterate Silver-Lace into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. And upon examination and proof, that Maſter <hi>Sands</hi> was couſened by buying this Silver-Thread for good Silver in <hi>London,</hi> it was ſent over to the <hi>Ruſsia</hi> Companie to have the offendors found out, vvhere upon examination before the Commiſsioners, twentie men run away.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:119441:68"/>
                        <p>By theſe good waies, I ſo ordered the Regulation of the Manufactures during the time of the Regulation, that the ſtuff was made all good Silver, and five Ounces to one pound <hi>Venice;</hi> and if any did work in Corners, that which was with a Cote of Copper, or againſt the rule, my Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſure to finde them out one time or another. And for doing of this ſervice, I had Warrants directed to ſeveral people for to diſcover the offendors; and becauſ I was true to my truſt, I would not ſuffer the Common-vvealth to bee couſened in this Manufacture (ſom men that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Common-vvealth in making of ſlight Gold and Silver-Thread, fear, if a Regulation ſhould bee ſettled by Parlament, to have no Silver-thread ſpun, either by the Hand or Spindle, but ſuch as is covered vvith a good Plate of Silver, and five Ounces Troie at the leaſt, to the pound Venice, that then they ſhall bee ſuffered to couſen no more; and this is the true reaſon of their anger againſt any that ſtand's for a Regulation; then they know their own guilt in ſo notorious defrauding the State in the Exciſe, and how much monie they owe the State in Arrears vvithin this four years, beeing above twentie thouſand pounds, vvhich is in the hands of fewer then thirtie men; and they know, if I bee commanded by the Parlament, I will give a good accompt of this buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly deſire Sir <hi>Robert Harlow,</hi> that my Grant might bee delivered to the Honorable Council for Trade, and that hee would pleaſ to report vvhat hee found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to your Honors; and that if I cannot maintain my Grant for the ſurveying the Manufacture of Gold and Silver-Wier, and Thread, for the good of the Common-wealth, and for the ſervice of the wearer, and honor of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, I ſhall with all humilitie laie my ſelf at the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Council for Trade's feet, ſo to regulate my Grant, as they in their great Wiſdoms ſhall finde moſt advantageous to the Common-vvealth.</p>
                        <p>And I do humbly farther propound to the Council
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119441:69"/> for Trade, that they would bee pleaſed to take notice that there is an Ordinance of Parlament of the ſixt of <hi>August,</hi> 1646. for all Gold and Silver-Wier, to paie four pence on the Ounce Troie, at the diſgroſsing at the Bar; and this Ordinance follow's in theſe words, <hi>viz. That four pence ſhall bee paid by waie of Exciſe, for everie Ounce of Silver Troie weight, and ſo for a greater or leſſer quantitie proportionable of Silver and Gold; that any Refiner, Gold-ſmith, or Gold-Wier drawer, or other that ſhall prepare, melt down, or diſgroſs for Wier; the ſame to bee paid by everie Refiner, Gold-ſmith, Gold-Wier-drawer, or other, at the Bar, where the ſame ſhall bee diſgroſſed. And that all Gold and Silver to bee diſgroſſed for Wier as aforeſaid, bee brought to one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, or places appointed, or to bee appointed by the Commiſsioners of the Exciſe, and not elſwhere; and that no Bars, Benches, Screws, Engins, or other Inſtruments for diſgroſsing of Silver, bee uſed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in any other place;</hi> this is in the Book of Ordinances; <hi>fol.</hi> 1114.</p>
                        <p>That for almoſt four years this four pence the Ounce did not make to the State above one thouſand pounds for all that time, of near upon four years. And during theſe four years, the Refiners of <hi>London</hi> beeing named in the Act, many of theſe Refiners durſt not ſell Guilt and Silver-Wier, without taking and ſecuring the dutie of four pence the Ounce to the State; whereupon rather then they would run into contempt of this Act, ſom of them gave over their trades, and others of them loſt their cuſtomers; for many of the Wier-drawers drew and refined all their own Silver, and never paid the State the duties reſerved by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and there remain's in the hands of ſom of the Gold-Wier-drawers, &amp; Refiners above twentie thouſand pounds, contrarie and in contempt of this Ordinance of Parlament, and which ſom of the ſaid Wier-drawers and Refiners are in Arrears to the State.</p>
                        <p>The Wier-drawers, and divers other Trades, having with great advantage made the wearer paie four pence the Ounce Venice for Exciſe, vvhen any bought it in Lace; and this
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119441:69"/> which I now put in writing, is, that the Gentrie may know what to paie for the future; for upon a true accompt, four pence an Ounce Troie in Silver-Wier, is not above one pennie farthing upon everie Ounce Venice in Silver. Thread: So though the Wier-drawers made a great advantage of the Exciſe, collecting far more from the Gentrie of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then four pence the Ounce Troie, yet they have not paid theſe Arrears to the State; a buſineſs of great concernment, now there is occaſion for monie, and require's a ſpeedie examination.</p>
                        <p>That for this laſt year, the Wier-drawers and Refiners did paie but one pennie the Ounce, which pennie make's now fifteen hundred pounds a year; ſo that four pence the Ounce would have been above ſix thouſand pounds a year, if the four pence had been juſtly gathered.</p>
                        <p>Now upon examination, it may bee proved there was more Silver-Wier diſgroſſed and made into Thread, and ſmall Wier, by the Refiners and Wier-drawers in everie of the years 1646, 1647, 1648, 1649, then in this laſt year 1650; ſo that by this accompt, there will clearly remain in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer's, and Maſter Wier-drawer's hands, above twentie thouſand pounds, and the number of them is not above thirtie men, which owe this monie, for which ſumme, they are tied by an Ordinance of Parlament, and no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge can bee given them of this debt, but by an Act of Parlament; for all that drew Silver at the Bar, are upon the drawing of it, bound to paie the State four pence the Ounce for vvhat they drew, and no perſons have any power to diſcharge this debt, but the Parlament; and if I bee required and impowered, I make no queſtion to give the State a good accompt of this debt.</p>
                        <p>I do moſt humbly deſire the Honorable Council for Trade, to take notice that by the eighth Article of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they are to conſider what Exciſe is fit to bee laid on all goods and commodities, and ſo equally and evenly laie it, that the State may not bee made uncapable to defraie
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119441:70"/> publick charges. Now I humbly deſire the Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Trade, to take eſpecial notice of this my humble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is, that one pennie on the Ounce Troie upon all Gold and Silver-Wier diſgroſſed at the Bar, and made into Gold and Silver. Thread, is no equal Exciſe in proportion to other commodities that are rated with Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are far more ſerviceable to the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, the Gold-Wier-drawers before any Exciſe was thought of, did offer unto the late King, and his heirs for ever, one thouſand pounds a year, and two pence the Ounce, to have a Corporation, as I ſhall make it appear. But the deceits ſo groſly practiſed by many of them, was ſo clearly proved that then at that time the State would not truſt them with a Corporation, as I have formerly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Neither would the late King and his Council truſt the Finers, but under a Regulation by Commiſsioners, though they ſaw paid the late King ſix pence the Ounce for all Gold and Silver diſgroſſed at the Bar, upon ſale of the Silver. Now I ſaie, after the Exciſe of one pennie the Ounce upon Silver and Guilt Wier, when it is Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured into Thread, it is not above ten ſhillings the hundred pounds Exciſe for ſom ſorts, and not above fifteen ſhillings in one hundred pounds worth upon any ſort of Gold and Silver. Thread, when it is Manufactured. And other ſorts of goods that are for uſe, and not ſuperfluous, paie's five pounds in the hundred.</p>
                        <p>Now if the State pleaſ to laie ſix pence on the Ounce for all Gold and Silver-Wier, that is diſgroſſed at the Bar, it is not above three pounds in one hundred for ſom ſorts of Gold and Silver-Thread, and four pounds ten ſhillings in the hundred pounds Exciſe for the heavieſt; when it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured, and it is a ſuperfluous commoditie, that if any will wear it, they ought to paie ſo much Exciſe as other commodities doth; and if the rules deſired in the Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinner's laſt printed Petition to your Honors, with ſom few other Obſervations on Maſter Atturnie General <hi>Bankes</hi>
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:119441:70"/> his Certificate, for the Regulating the Manufacture, the State will make ſix thouſand pounds a year of it, and the Manufacture all made right, both for the fineneſs of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the juſt covering of the Thread, with a good plate, and to ſettle a comfortable livelihood for the labor of all the poor working Wier-drawers, and Silver-ſpinners, that have a right to the Trade by ſervice or ſeven years uſage; and the ſupernumerarie Maſter-Wier-drawers, and Work-men, to bee excluded the Trade, that have not ſerved for it, or not wholly followed it for ſeven years.</p>
                        <p>I humbly deſire your Honors to take notice by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parlament, that laie's four pence upon all Silver diſgroſſed at the Bar, dated the ſixt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1646. all Gold and Silver-Thread was to bee made up in ſcanes, and to bee ſealed without any fee: and this no doubt was moved to bee put in by ſom people who knew verie well, if there were no fee allowed, there could bee no ſervice don; and that which hath made the Citie of <hi>London</hi> ſo full of ſlight Silver-Thread, is the neglecting the ſurveying of it: For how could any Sealer give his attendance, warrant the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Nation, and to any Merchants, to bee good Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, both according to the Standard of the Silver, and that it contain's in one pound Venice, five Ounces of Silver; (and without this warrant to the buier, what good doth the ſealing of it?) While I had the ſurveying of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, which was above four years, I warranted it all to the Common-wealth; and I challenge any Wier-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Finer, or Silk-man in <hi>London,</hi> to produce one pound of bad or ſlight Silver, I ever ſealed at the Office, or that any man could ever faſten one pennie on mee, or other reward, for conniving at any man that did not work good Silver.</p>
                        <p>It is well known, I did alwaies ſtand to reliev the poor work-men, and work-women, while I had the Office, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their oppreſsing work-maſters, in cauſing their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters not to deliver them bad Silver, or ſuch as would not work by reaſon of the not refining of it well, and made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119441:71"/> the Refiners change it, though it were good according to the Standard, yet not beeing well drieteſted, it would bring the poor work-men a great deal of trouble and loſs, by reaſon of the Quick-Silver.</p>
                        <p>That I was ſtrict to ſee all men work good Silver, and to cauſ thoſe that did not to bee puniſhed, I confeſs it ot bee true, and it did concern mee to do it, for elſ I had brought a ſcandal on the Manufacture, and my Office, and I might have been undon in warranting the commoditie to bee all right that was ſealed in the Office. And if the Wier-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could have proved but any Gold and Silver-Thread, with all their vigilant ſearch throughout the Citie, that had been ſealed, that was courſ Silver, or held not five Ounces to everie pound Venice, it had gon in to the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a full crie: but though they ſought, and ſought carefully, to finde it out, that either I or my ſervants had ſealed any bad Silver, they could not finde one Ounce; though I am ſure I and my ſervants in the time I had the Office, ſealed above one Million of Scanes of Gold and Silver; and it was a great mercie of God to mee, the Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers vvith all the tricks they uſed, could get no courſ or ſlight Silver-Thread to produce to the Parlament. But miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their mark in that deſign, they with ſom Refiners, whoſe tongues I have found more ſharp then a two-edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſword, with the greateſt induſtrie, ſubtilly ſpit out the poiſon of Aſps, which naturally grow's in ſom of their mouths, or elſ ſo much untruth could not bee invented as they beſtowed upon mee; the poiſon of their mouths and tongues beeing to mee as venomous as the <hi>Aqua-Fortis</hi> they make: For in the beginning of this Parlament, ſom of them caſt about the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and to people that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew mee, as if I had been the worſt man living.</p>
                        <p>And though the Finers and Wierdrawers of <hi>London</hi> both Petitioned the late King for their Trade, as I ſaid before, and each ſtriving which of them ſhould ſet their trade in ſuch a waie that might bring them in the moſt for their particular
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119441:71"/> profit; vvhen they had moulded all their Regulation, then I was nominated Surveyor and Sealer of all the Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the late King, which I did diſcharge faithfully, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould not couſen the Common-vvealth; for my doing thereof, ſom of them clamored moſt lewdly againſt mee about the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> And ſom which I know did uſe theſe unworthie vvaies to defame and ſlander mee, are now diſcovered, and held themſelvs unworthie men, and in as much contempt with the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> as they put upon their neighbors. It is not their removing out of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> can make their curſed remembrance bee forgot: Theſe reſtleſs ſpirits have left no ſtone unmoved to do mee a miſchief, and to preſent mee as a Malignant, and diſ-affected to this Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Truly I will declare to all the world, I ever loved and honored the late King with all my heart, as long as hee bad breath in his bodie, and would have don him any juſt ſervice; and nothing beyond that I would have don, and I am confident no gallant man will condemn mee for ſpeaking this truth. Now hee is dead, I am free with the ſame faith and humble dutie, and ſomthing more, by reaſon my afflictions hath got mee ſom more experience, I will conſtantly ſerv this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament and the Common wealth of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now ſettled without King or Lords, to the laſt drop of bloud in my bodie, againſt any perſon that oppoſe's them, and will do the Parlament all juſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Common-wealth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I thank God I never by any was deſired farther; and if I ſhould, I would bid any that ask's mee to do it, do it themſelvs. Yet theſe Moles, ſom of the Refiners, and ſom of the Wier-drawers, vvould introduce to ſom of my friends, that I am a dangerous Inſtrument for ſom of the State; ſo that theſe men's tongues are like ſaws, with croſs teeth, (if I bee of the King's ſide, I ſhall bee blaſted, when the King is dead; if I ſerv the State, I ſhall not ſcape them) but if they had reſted with words, I ſhould better have born their malice: But this laſt <hi>Michaëlmas</hi> Term, they fell on mee with deeds, took mee upon an Execution at the ſuit
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119441:72"/> of one Widow <hi>Simonds,</hi> wife of one <hi>Joſeph Simonds,</hi> when I never vvarranted any Atturnie to appear for mee, and I had a Releaſ of the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Simonds</hi> for to withdraw all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and thereupon I delivered him an Ingot of Silver which was ſeized on by the late King's Commiſsioners, by order of the Lords of the Council, and this was don eleven years ago. I never owed this woman or her husband one pennie, and I make no queſtion but I ſhall have reparation, and to finde out the confederacie againſt mee.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Joſeph Simonds</hi> brought the ſame Action againſt Sir <hi>John Wollaston,</hi> Alderman <hi>Gibs,</hi> Sir <hi>William Becher,</hi> Maſter Alderman <hi>Hariſon,</hi> and divers others, and they all non-ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſeveral times; and if I had known the declaration againſt mee, I would have pleaded and gotten off as well as others; but I was in the Countie of <hi>Darbie-ſhire,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew of it till there was Judgment entred upon a <hi>Nihil Dicit,</hi> and a Writ of Inquirie of Damages, when I had the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Simond's</hi> Releaſ atteſted by five witneſſes, and I found this Releaſ by a ſtrange accident after I had loſt this Acquitance, about ten years, the tenth of this preſent <hi>Januarie;</hi> this I put down openly, that as I was affronted publickly on the Exchange, by beeing arreſted there, upon an unjuſt Action all men ſhould know I cannot bee arreſted for a juſt Debt.</p>

                        <p>Beyond Seas it is not permitted to a Sergeant to arreſt any man on the Exchange, and it were verie fit it ſhould bee ſo here in <hi>London;</hi> for many Merchants are crazie commodities, and their reputation's not to bee touched, leſt they fall in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I ſpeak not for my ſelf, for I owe not one hundred pounds in the world, that any bodie can juſtly ask mee, though I have had taken from mee by Order of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees above eight thouſand four hundred pounds, and I have left off trading this ten years: But I know there is a great neceſsitie at this time for Merchants not to bee arreſted on the Exchange, for the humor of many Engliſh Uſurers and ſom others is, that if they finde a man ſinking, everie man enter's his Action, and pul's ſomtimes a good Eſtate in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whereas they ſhould do as they do in <hi>Holland,</hi> if their debtors have loſſes at ſea, or by fire, or bad debts, they plaie the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> binde up their wounds, and inſtead of adding affliction to their debtor, comfort him, and by this careful uſage, many a ſcore of men beyond ſeas have recovered their Eſtates, and been gallant Merchants again; whereas here they fling them into priſons, and ruine them. But for ſuch Merchants or others, that break out of knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to couſen men by their Compoſition, as too many do, or ſuch as have Diced or Whored away their Eſtates, and then break in other men's debts, I deſire from my heart, and humbly praie, a Law may bee made to make it Felonie in any that hath, or ſhall do it; I am credibly told it is ſo in <hi>France,</hi> and other Forrain parts.</p>
                        <p>But that which was the Maſter-piece of all the Refiner's plots to deſtroie mee, was, when by the ſubtiltie of two of them they put mee into the Tower for three years and eleven months, and did engage great and honorable men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee, for what ſom of them knew themſelvs long before I did, and I did nothing but by warrant of publick Officers. By which falſ information, they cauſed mee to bee ſequeſtred of my Eſtate, and damnified, and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the value of eight thouſand pounds, and kept cloſe

                        <p>For the true Examination of all the tranſaction of that buſineſs, I am an humble ſuitor to the Parlament to have Juſtice, and that the truth of this buſineſs might bee found out, and that it may bee referred to the Honorable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Examinations, and then it will bee found this deſign was to blaſt and undo mee, and by that means, to prevent mee that I ſhould not tell the State what I knew to bee true, and ſhould never com to bee heard in what I could ſerv the State; for as they had laid the deſign for my life and good name, it was one hundred to one, that ever I eſcaped their mortal ſnare.</p>

                        <p>Upon Maſter <hi>Elconhead's</hi> ſeveral times attending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and not proving his Charge againſt mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Committee; according to theſe Orders I did Petition the Committee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that they would require the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of <hi>Battels</hi> and <hi>Paton.</hi> Hall, to forbear to paie <hi>Edward Elconhead</hi> any more rent, and to require <hi>Ed. Elconhead</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring into the Committee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> all ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that hee had received by vertue of their Order or Orders, on the Manors of <hi>Battels</hi> and <hi>Paton</hi>-Hall, to bee depoſited into the Committee's hands, till my cauſ was examined in Parlament; for Maſter <hi>Edward Elconhead</hi> finding I was in the diſpleaſure of the Parlament, thought at once to give mee a paiment both for Maſter <hi>Waad's</hi> debt, and my life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore M. <hi>Elconhead</hi> charge's mee with a Conſpiracie againſt the Parlament before the Committee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as appear's under the Committee's hands by the two aforeſaid Warrants; then Maſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> compound's with the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> for three hundred pounds, that which I had all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Waad's</hi> Lands under Extent, worth one thouſand pounds Land a year, to paie mee one thouſand pounds due to mee in 1643. which Lands of Maſter <hi>James Waad,</hi> upon color of this Sequeſtration of the Committee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Maſter <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conhead</hi> ever ſince hold's in his hands, and keep's Maſter <hi>Waad's</hi> Creditors without their Monie; and though Maſter <hi>Waad</hi> hath a great Eſtate, more then will paie his debts, if it were well managed, to live like a Gentleman, yet Maſter <hi>Waad</hi> is kept in priſon in great want, and Maſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> receiv's his Eſtate without any Accompt. And I had three ſeveral Bonds in two thouſand pounds as aforeſaid, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing my monie. Now if I had forfeited my Eſtate to the uſe of the Countie of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> the Committee for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were not good husbands for the Countie, to let Maſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> have one thouſand pounds good Eſtate for three hundred pounds; for they had Lands tied for it in their own Countie of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of above three hundred pounds a year value. But the truth is, I have enquired whether
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119441:78"/> ever any monie was paid into the uſe of the Countie by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Edward Elconhead</hi> of this three hundred pounds, and I cannot finde any paid for the uſe of the Countie. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire the Committee for the Accompts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, would take notice of it, and have it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I ſhall leav Maſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> to the world, to judg of him, to give mee a Charge of Treaſon, and then by that means to get my Eſtate for a quarter of the pretended ſumme hee compounded for, when I was cloſe priſoner in the Tower, and could not make my defence; and then M. <hi>Edward Elconhead</hi> the 28 of <hi>Julie</hi> 1649. to denie before the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> that hee ever charged mee with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt the Parlament, though it bee atteſted by the Committees of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Warrant as aforeſaid; and that Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Gentleman Sir <hi>Will. Rowe,</hi> told then to M. <hi>Elconhead</hi> before the Committee, that if hee could not prove my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt the Parlament, hee had don mee <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> wrong, and the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> wrong; for it was onely upon M. <hi>Elconhead's</hi> Information to the Committee of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that the Committee certified any thing againſt mee to the Parlament, and wiſhed M. <hi>Elconhead</hi> to bring the Acquitance of the Committee, for what monie hee had paid for this Extent, and hee ſaid the Ordinance of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for giving my Eſtate away, which I had in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, beeing an Extent on the Manors of <hi>Battel</hi> and <hi>Paton</hi>-Hall, was made on the Committee's Information to the Parlament againſt mee, and their information was onely grounded on M. <hi>Elconhead</hi> to the Committee; and if hee could not prove his Charge, the Sequeſtration would ceaſ, and what monie M. <hi>Elconhead</hi> could prove hee paid to the uſe of the Countie, ſhould bee paid him back; for if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> failed in the foundation, all that was don on that Charge againſt mee would ceaſ, and I ought to bee reſtored to the poſſeſsion of my Lands in the Countie, but as yet I could not get the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to reſtore mee to my poſſeſsion, Maſter <hi>Elconhead</hi> deſiring further

                              <p>TRuſtie and Well-beloved, Wee greet you well. When Wee remember the many Acts of Grace and Favor Wee and Our Roial Predeceſſors have conferred upon that Our Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the manie Examples of eminent Dutie and Loialtie, for which that Citie hath been likwiſe famous, Wee are willing to believ, notwithſtanding the great defection Wee have found in that place, that all men are not ſo far degenerated from their affection to Us, and to the Peace of the Kingdom, as to deſire a continuance of the miſeries they now feel; and therefore beeing informed, that there is a deſire in ſom principal Perſons of that Citie to preſent a Petition to Us, which may tend to the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a good underſtanding between Us, and that Our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereby the Peace of the whole Kingdom may bee procured: Wee have thought fit to let you know, That Wee are readie to receiv any ſuch Petition, and the Perſons who ſhall bee appointed to preſent the ſame to Us, ſhall have a ſafe conduct; And you ſhall aſſure all Our good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Our Citie, whoſe hearts are touched with any ſenſ of dutie to Us, or of Love to the Religion and Laws eſtabliſhed, in the quiet and peaceable fruition whereof they and their. Anceſtors have enjoied ſo great Happineſs, That Wee have neither paſſed any Act, nor made any Profeſsion or Proteſtation for the Maintenance and Defence of the true Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of the Subject,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119441:79"/> which Wee will not moſt ſtrictly and religiouſly obſerv; and for the which Wee will not bee alwaies readie to give them any ſecuritie that can bee deſired. And of theſe Our Gracious Letters Wee exſpect a ſpeedie Anſwer from you. And ſo Wee bid you farewell.</p>

                        <p>UPon the bringing up to <hi>London</hi> of the aforeſaid Letter of the late King, I <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was examined before an Honorable Committee at Gold-ſmith's Hall the third of <hi>Januarie</hi> 1643. where I made the Honorable Committee acquainted, that the later of Maſter <hi>Read's</hi> Letters I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Maſter <hi>Theophilus Rilie</hi> Scout-Maſter of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> who was autoriſed by Ordinance of both Houſes of Parlament, and by Act of the Common-Council of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> to hold Intelligence in any of the King's Quarters; and that the ſaid <hi>Theophilus Rilie</hi> did daily emploie Intelligencers into the King's Quarters by Order of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London,</hi> and by autoritie of the Parlament, as hee told mee <hi>Tho. Violet;</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Theophilus Rilie,</hi> by virtue of his place, did procure my Paſs from the then Parlament to go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the twentie fift daie of <hi>December,</hi> 1643. as appear's by the Journal-Books in the Houſ of Commons; and my Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi> did give mee a Paſs to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> in Exchange for Maſter <hi>Haſlerig,</hi> then priſoner in <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Caſtle, and this Warrant of my Lord General's, Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Haſlerig</hi> procured mee by means of Maſter <hi>Rilie,</hi> I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoner, committed by the Parlament for my Twentie part; both which Warrants were procured for mee <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> by <hi>Theophilus Rilie</hi> Scout-Maſter of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and I <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> did before the Honorable Committee plead Juſtification for my doing what I did, having the Warrant and Approbation of the Common-wealth's Scout-maſter for what I had don.</p>
                        <p>And I then told the Honorable Committee that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Warrant from Maſter <hi>Rilie</hi> for what I did, was as ſufficient as if I had had Maſter <hi>Elſing's</hi> Warrant: for M. <hi>Rilie</hi> was as hee told mee approved on by Order of Lords &amp; Commons, and I knew by the conſent of the Common-Council of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> to bee Scout-maſter for the Citie; and if hee were a man unfit for ſuch a truſt &amp; power, it was the fault in thoſe that choſe him, and not in mee w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:119441:80"/> was not to queſtion his power, abilities, or truſt, but to act according to his directions, as long as hee had the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Scout-Maſter.</p>
                        <p>Moreover I told the Honorable Committee, that before I went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I deſired Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> Knight, to make the Committee of both Nations, who ſate then at <hi>Darbie-</hi>Houſ, acquainted with what I had don with Maſter <hi>Rilie</hi> the Scout-maſter of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> that ſo I might do nothing but by the approbation of the Committee of both Kingdoms; and Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> did make ſom of them acquainted with what I had don with Maſter <hi>Rilie,</hi> and I had their approbation to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> for the late King's Letter, and my Lord General's Paſs as aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>Moreover I declared to the Honorable Committeee at Gold-ſmith's Hall, that there was not then at the time of my bringing up of the late King's Letter, (beeing the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Januarie</hi> 1643.) any Ordinance or Order to forbid mee or any other perſon to bring up a Letter of Peace from the late King as ever I then heard of; and that by God's Law, <hi>where there is no Law, there can bee no Tranſgreſsion;</hi> and my bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the late King's Letter up to <hi>London,</hi> before a Law made to ſhew mee my rule to walk by, I humbly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved could bee no offence.</p>
                        <p>And the reaſon wherefore I was willing to go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the late King's Letter, was, becauſ I was told that ſom in <hi>London</hi> had procured the late King to ſend mee his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that I ſhould not diſcover the <hi>Tranſporters of Gold</hi> &amp; <hi>Silver</hi> to the Parlament, which I offered then the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do. And if I had not then been by the ſubtiltie of ſom Finers, and ſom Tranſporters of Gold, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the Honorable Committee againſt mee, (&amp; caſt mee into the Tower) but had been emploied by the Parlament to make the Diſcoverie of the Tranſporters of Treaſure, I ſaie, that all the Gold and Silver that ſince hath been Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (which hath been a greater miſchief to the Nation then can bee expreſſed) had never been ſent away; and by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119441:81"/> the fines of the offendors, would have com to the State a great and conſiderable ſumme to paie publick debts, and ſuch a Regulation ſettled by the Parlament, that none ſhould have preſumed to have Tranſported Gold or Silver for the future.</p>

                        <p>And to get the late King to take off his Commands which hee ſent mee by the aforeſaid Letter, and to give mee leav to Diſcover the Tranſporters of Gold &amp; Silver, was the onely reaſon that I went to <hi>Oxford:</hi> When I came to <hi>Oxford</hi>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:119441:81"/> I beſought the late King to give mee leav to make the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie to the Parlament againſt the Tranſportes of Gold, but hee would not, and told mee hee reſerved that buſineſs for himſelf, for it would make him good ſtore of monie when hee came to <hi>London.</hi> Then I praied him to give mee leav to paie my Twentie part to the Parlament, and that it ſhould bee no damage to mee, in regard the late King owed mee one thouſand nine hundred ſixtie eight pounds for what I had laid out in diſcovering the Tranſporters of Gold, which hee readily conſented to do, and bid mee paie all Taxes laid on mee, and that ſhould not prejudice my debt hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee, nor his favor to mee, and that hee would ſee mee paid as ſoon hee was able.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly deſire the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier,</hi> and all others that have my Eſtate, to take notice that everie one that is committed to the Tower by the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not guiltie of a Conſpiracie againſt the Parlament. Col. <hi>Monk</hi> hee was committed to the Tower, and cleared, and at this daie a moſt gallant man in the Northern Armie; Sir <hi>Tho. Bendiſh</hi> in the Tower, and cleared, and now Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and many Honorable Members of this Parlament have been committed upon diſpleaſure of the Parlament, and yet reſtored to ſit in Parlament again; I am ſure of it I am, and can bee more ſerviceable to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament of <hi>England,</hi> then any Finer or Tranſporter of Gold hath, or can bee, that malitiouſly have charged mee to bee a Malignant, for I will bring the State in fiftie thouſand pounds, if they will paſs the Act againſt Tranſporting of Gold. And I humbly conceiv, no man ought to have his Eſtate taken from him, and given away, before hee bee convicted by Martial Law, or the Common Law of the Land. If thoſe that have malitiouſly informed the Honorable Committee that examined mee at Gold-ſmiths Hall, could have made good their Charge, or have proved any thing to my prejudice, they would have brought mee to my Trial in the compaſs of four years, while I was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119441:82"/> in the Tower; I could not have avoided a Trial, or kept it off one daie, and I know they left no ſtone unrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for they ſate many daies to have don mee a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and I have it from good hands; that worthie Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Doctor <hi>Doreſlaws</hi> told them, I had don nothing but what I could juſtifie, having M. <hi>Theophilus Rilie's</hi> approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Warrant, hee beeing a publick Officer of Truſt; and if any were in fault, it was M. <hi>Theophilus Rilie,</hi> who had abuſed his place and Truſt, if hee had don any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Commiſſion. But the truth was, they looked more to keep mee cloſe priſoner in the Tower, (that ſo I ſhould not diſcover them that ſent away the Treaſure of the Nation) then any thing elſ; for they knew if I were abroad, I would have ſerved the Parlament in that Diſcoverie.</p>
                        <p>To the Honorable Council for Trade I am an humble ſuitor, for reſtoring mee to my Office for the Regulating the Manufacture of Gold and Silver-Thread, the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is now depending before them, and with all my heart I humbly ſhall laie it at thoſe grave Senator's feet, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late mee and my fee, as they ſhall ſee the Office juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and for the benefit of the Common-wealth, and no further.</p>
                        <p>For the Goods, Bonds, and Accompts taken at ſeveral times from my mother while I was in the Tower, J ſhall humbly deſire any perſons that did ſequeſter them, to let mee know of it, whither they were carried, and how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, and J ſhall bee bound to praie for them; and if they bee inferior Officers, or others, that can tell mee, they ſhall bee well rewarded by mee and God's bleſsing; for as yet J cannot hear who hath them, and my mother died in my cloſe impriſonment in the Tower; and though by the great favor of Maſter <hi>Henrie Martin</hi> one of the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Council of State, J had libertie to go and ſee my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whilſt J was priſoner in the Tower, with two keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet when J came to her, ſhee was ſo ſpent, and her heart broke for my oppreſsions, ſhee beeing threeſcore and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119441:82"/> ſeventeen years old, that ſhee could not tell mee any thing of my buſineſs, nor give mee the leaſt notice in the world who had taken my Goods, Bonds, and Accompts away, other then that ſhee was plundered ſeveral times; and this old Maſter <hi>White</hi> the Warder of the Tower, Maſter <hi>Axtel,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Jackſon,</hi> keepers in the Tower, know's to bee true, who were with mee all the times J ſaw her.</p>
                        <p>For my Farm in the Cuſtom-Houſ, &amp; for the late King's debt, with all my aforeſaid loſſes, J do moſt humbly leav it to the Parlament, for my ſatisfaction; and J praie that the Committee of <hi>Shrop-ſhier</hi> may bee Ordered to reſtore mee my Bonds they ſeized of mine from my ſiſter in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> beeing three Bonds in two thouſand pounds for the paying mee <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> one thouſand pounds as aforeſaid; and that J may bee enabled by Order of Parlament to ſue the ſaid Bonds, and any other Bonds or Debts J have due to mee; and the parties owing mee any monie that I can juſtly prove due to mee, may bee required by the Parlament to paie it to mee, notwithſtanding any Ordinance or Order of Parlament heretofore made; and my humble ſuit is to the Parlament, that the Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> bee Ordered to put mee into poſſeſsion of the Manors of <hi>Battels.</hi> Hall, and <hi>Paton.</hi> Hall, they having forcibly driven <hi>Philip Cage</hi> out, when hee was in poſſeſsion for the uſe of mee <hi>Tho. Violet,</hi> as appear's by their own Orders, and that I may enjoie all the ſaid Lands till the rent of ſixteen hundred pounds bee paid mee, for ſo much I am out of purſ.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, this envie of ſom of the Finers, and ſom of the Wier-drawers, came upon mee becauſ I would not let the Wier-drawers couſen the late King of his dutie while I had the Office, but to the uttermoſt of my power made them make all good Silver-Thread, and to have five Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the pound Venice, and right Silver; and I have heard ſom of the Wier-drawers confeſs, that they had rather the State ſhould choſe fortie Officers to look after the Exciſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119441:83"/> and Regulation of this Manufacture, then one <hi>Violet.</hi> And this, though it bee a crime to them, is a ſervice to the State, to have ſuch an Officer, which know's all the waies how they are couſened in their Exciſe in this Manufacture, and to prevent it: and had not my place of ſurveying of this Manufacture been but I had ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied it, the State ſhould have had twentie thouſand pounds in their purſ more then they have, onely by the Exciſe on the commoditie of Gold and Silver-Wier; and all this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is loſt through the ignorance of the Officers of Exciſe, who know not how to manage the buſineſs; for I know the State many times hath Officers put into ſuch places through the intereſt and affection of friends, that are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncapable of ſuch places they enjoie; whereby the State is at great charges in fees and ſalaries to ignorant men. But that is not the tenth part of the miſchief the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſuffer's by their fees; for through theſe men's igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, the State is couſened of the duties that ſhould ſupport the Common-wealth, as is notoriouſly viſible in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Gold and Silver-Wier, which at four pence the Ounce at the Bar, which is laid on it by Ordinance aforeſaid, would have made the State ſix thouſand pounds a year: and by the ignorance and negligence of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Exciſe, it hath made the State not three hundred pounds a year for almoſt four years, which is not the twentie pennie of what ought to have been collected. And if I had had my place, I would have ſeen everie pennie the Wier-drawers then paid for Exciſe, made twentie pence to the State.</p>
                        <p>And this the Refiners and Wier-drawers know to bee true, and that make's ſom of them ſo unwilling that I ſhould have my Office again; they fear I ſhould bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the State to uſe my uttermoſt endeavors for the collecting of thoſe Arrears that are in the Wier-drawer's and Refiner's hands, and to reſtrain them for the future, many of them having bought Lands and grown rich with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119441:83"/> the monie they owe to the State, which is fitter to paie the Arrears of the Armie, then to lie in their hands.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas the diſpute is, which can afford it chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, the Wheels or the Hand-ſpinners, I ſaie, the beſt is beſt cheap; the Hand-ſpinners, work will make two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence, and three ſhillings the Ounce to the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pot, and laſt ſix times as long in Lace, as ſom of the Wheel-work will do; and when this Wheel-work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn's to the melting pot, it make's not one ſhilling ſix pence the Ounce, nay, ſom of it not twelv pence the Ounce, the Silver beeing moſt of it galled and bruſhed off the Silk. And this the Gold-ſmiths and Tailors know to bee true, that within this ten years all the ſlight Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work came up, which make's not half ſo much to burn, as it did formerly in Lace. And whereas it is objected that ſom of the Hand-ſpinners work and ſpin Silver-Thread, as ſlight as the Wheels, which I believ cannot bee don; but if it bee don, they ought both Wheel-ſpinners, and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinners, to bee ſeverely puniſhed, if they do not put into one pound Venice of Thread, at leaſt five Ounces Troie of Silver-plate; and a ſworn Officer that is no Trader in the Manufacture to Regulate the Trade, for whatſoever they put leſs in Silver then five Ounces Troie to one pound Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, is a damage to the wearer, and the wearer is cheated by paying for Silver, when hee Silk for his monie, by which means the Lace will not wear a quater ſo long as if the Silver were bound in with a ſtrong plate of Silver; for you may obſerv your ſlight Silver Laces, one part where it com's to wearing, that look's like Silk Laces, the Silver beeing all ſtripped and galled off the Silk; but make it with a ſtrong plate, you ſhall have the Silk wear away, and the Silver remain.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly deſire in the behalf of the poor Women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinners, and ſom of the working Wier-drawers of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that their printed Petition for a Regulation of the trade may bee conſidered; And for the ſervice of the Common-wealth,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119441:84"/> that a rule may by your Honors bee ſet, what fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Silver all the Gold and Silver emploied in the Wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer's Trade, ſhall bee made, and that it bee all aſſaied at the Bar, and that what perſon ſoever, that ſhall ſell Gold or Silver-Wier, before it bee aſſaied, and the duties paid, which ſhall bee ſettled by your Honors, and approved on by the Parlament, ſhall for the firſt offence loſe all the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wrought to the State, and the partie that ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to have one tenth part for his ſervice; and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond offence, to loſe his or their freedom, and bee diſmiſſed of his and their Trades for ever.</p>
                        <p>The like penalties for ſuch as work Silver courſer then the Standard, and ſuch as paie not the duties at the Bar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the State, and ſuch as do not put five Ounces of Silver at the leaſt upon everie Venice pound of Gold and Silver-Thread.</p>
                        <p>Then I humbly commend unto your Honors as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern for a Regulation, the Copie of Sir <hi>John Bank's</hi> Certificate (the late King's Atturnie General) to the late King; which if you tie the Wier-drawers and Refiners to that rule, the Trade will bee maintained here to the Profit and Honor of the Nation.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is objected, that ſom of the Spinners by the Hand make as ſlight Gold and Silver-Thread, as the Wheels: Truly if they do, they ought to bee puniſhed, any Hand-ſpinner that put's leſs Silver in a pound Venice, then five Ounces Troie of Silver; for whether the ſlight Thread bee made by hte the Hand-ſpinners or Wheels, is not ſo much to the point, for which of them ſoever doth it, couſen's the Common-wealth: and therefore a ſworn Officer to look to them both, is for the ſervice of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</p>
                        <p>But if it bee left to the Refiners, and Wier-drawers, to melt up the Plate and heavie Coin of this Nation, as they have don, for this Manufacture, the Trade ſo managed is a canker to the Common-wealth, and will in time eat out
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119441:84"/> the bowels of the ſtock of Monie of this Nation.</p>
                        <p>I my ſelf when I was an Apprentice, delivered to Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Gibs</hi> for my Maſter, in little more then one above twentie thouſand heavie ſhillings and ſix pences melted into Ingots; and when I told his brother <hi>Richard Gibs</hi> within this two moneths, that hee knew it to bee true, for at that time hee was his brother's Apprentice, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it was not in Coin, but in Ingots, and that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv's might excuſe his brother.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, as this Trade is managed, it is a great waſte of the treaſure of the Nation, for this is the uſual waie of it to furniſh ſom of the Refiners and ſom of the Wier-drawers with Silver; ſom of the Gold-ſmiths they are general Caſhiers for many Merchants, they receiv this monie for nothing, then when they have it in their houſes, they cull it and melt down that which is the weightieſt, and melt it into Ingots, which is bought up by ſom of the Refiners, and ſom Wier-drawers, and fined for Gold and Silver Lace; and according as ſom of the Manufactures are made by the Wheels, five parts of ſix are ſwept away and waſted, and never return's to the melting pot, and this is known and ſeen to many men.</p>
                        <p>And for this, and other abuſes practiſed on the Coin and Bullion of the Nation, there is the draft of an Act of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commended from the Council of State, and twice read in the Houſ, which when it is paſt, I ſhall with all humilitie give the State a true diſcoverie of all theſe abuſes, and prevent the like for the time to com, which will bee a great ſervice to the Nation.</p>
                        <p>Then that there may bee an accompt kept of all the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made in this Manufacture, and ſuch Merchants contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oted with, that once in the compaſs of a year, what is ſpent in this Manufacture, may bee coined, or at leaſt ſo much, as upon a calculation of the ſurveior of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, ſhall bee delivered to the State that hee conceiv's the Bullion and Treaſure is waſted: But for your Honors
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119441:85"/> to ſettle the Trade of Refining of Gold and Silver, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-drawing, in a Corporation, as it is now deſired by the Wier-drawers, it were to make all the ſpeed poſsible, that that little Silver in Coin which is yet left in the Nation, ſhould bee culled and melted up for Gold and Silver Lace, and leav it to their good diſcretions and honeſties, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the other parts of their Trade. The poor Spinners and ſom work-men, deſire your Honors to the contrarie; for as they have beaten them down in the prices, that many of them are readie to ſtarv, ſo if the whole power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Trade were left to ſixteen of their wiſdoms and diſcretions, which is a Maſter, and Wardens, and Aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, then ſhould the work-men and work-women's face bee ground and oppreſt. Theſe Maſter-work-men that deſire this Corporation, are not fortie, and the work-men and work-women thouſands; I ſhall with all humilitie tell you what Forrain Nations do to Regulate their Monie and Bullion, &amp; theſe Manufactures: and unleſs you have the like rule here, I humbly conceiv it will be impoſsible to reſtore the Mint, to keep the Gold-ſmiths within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or the Wier-drawers in any rule; for many of them have got to licentious height and pride, having got great Eſtates by culling Monie, ſelling Gold and Silver to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, buying of clipped Monie, and paying it away again, and twentie other tricks, that they are ſo proud, they know not whether they ſtand on their heels or their head; but the Act againſt tranſporting theſe, when it com's forth, will regulate them all.</p>
                        <p>I ſaie, if you will have theſe abuſes rectified as in <hi>France, Flanders, Spain, Germanie,</hi> and other Countries, I humbly conceiv, you muſt erect a Council for Monies and Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for in <hi>France</hi> I have ſeen great Volumes of Arguments of the Government and Management of Monie and Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the due Regulation is of mightie importance as your affairs now ſtand; and in all Forrain Countries, the States, that are Kings, or Common-wealths, have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119441:85"/> care, and make the myſteries of managing their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, matter of the greateſt ſtate and policie; and Gold and Silver, either in Coin or Bullion, the late Kings &amp; Queens in <hi>England,</hi> did ever appropriate the eſpecial management of them to themſelvs, as beeing a buſineſs of State.</p>
                        <p>And though now by the bleſsing of God, wee are a free State, and the Nation a free Nation, I humbly conceiv, not ſo free, that the Bullion and Coin of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould bee Manufactured and waſted without any accompt, and without any regard for the bringing in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Bullion for the proportion is ſpent here, in the making Gold and Silver-Thread, without offering the State an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe fit for to bee impoſed on ſo ſuperfluous a commoditie; when theſe Wier-drawers voluntarily offered the late King one thouſand pound a year, and two pence an Ounce, and the Refiners did give the late King ſix pence the Ounce; and this to bee don in a King's time, in a time when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth had no Armies to paie; which ſix pence the Ounce, almoſt all of it was given by the late King to a couple of Courtiers, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> two thouſand pounds a year, the Counteſs of <hi>Roxborough</hi> twelv hundred pounds a year. If the Wier-drawers would paie the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears they owe to the State, and ſubmit to a Regulation for the preſent, and binde themſelvs to work good Silver, well covered with five Ounces Silver to a pound Venice, ſeal all the Gold and Silver-Thread as formerly, and paie the duties ſhall bee impoſed on them by the State for Exciſe, and keep an accompt of all the Silver Manufactured by a Comptroler, there might bee ſom hopes that this Manufacture might bee regulated: if they will not, I humbly conceiv, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament paſs the Act againſt Tranſporting Gold and Silver, and have a Council for Monies, according as it is in other Countries, it will regulate the abuſes of this Trade, and all others that trade in Gold and Silver.</p>
                        <p>If the State had had a Council for Monies eight years ago, as they have in Forrain Countries, I believe <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs</hi>
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:119441:86"/> would have yielded them more Monies then it made the State: I do humbly deſire that it may bee examined, how many fodder of Lead was made of the Croſs; for all the figures were Lead, and who bought it, and what they paid a fodder, and the total ſumme in monie was paid for it.</p>
                        <p>Then I do humbly deſire to have the partie or parties that bought the Lead of the Croſs examined upon Oath, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did ever fine or refine the Lead, and parted the Gold from the Lead, by blowing it down in an Almond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnace, and then refining it on atteſt; and what Gold they extracted out of it, to give a juſt accompt of the pound weights and Ounces of Gold, hee or they refined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Lead of <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then that all men would bee pleaſed to take notice of the long continuance of <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs,</hi> ſince it was made, and in how many King's and Queen's Reigns it was guilt, the Citie-Books I believ will ſhew, this verie Croſs with the Leaden figures.</p>
                        <p>And then that they take notice that the Rain and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decaie's not the Gold, for it will ſink into the Lead; and though it change color, and tarniſh with the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the Bodie of Gold is in the Lead. And all men know the ſuperſtition of former times did not care what Gold they laid on Popiſh Reliques; and I believ the Citie-Books will ſhew many thouſand pounds laid out in Gold for guilding <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions.</p>
                        <p>I do humbly conceiv that when the Croſs was ſold, it was ſold by the State onely for Lead, and the State had no more for it but for Lead; and if any did refine, and part that Lead, and converted the Gold to their own uſe, (that all that Gold w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was ſold for two pence the pound weight, the State ought to have an accompt for it) and my deſire to them that bought it, is, that they would give the juſt value of all the Gold they extracted out of <hi>Cheapſide-Croſs,</hi> to the poor maimed ſoldiers, towards their relief and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119441:86"/> they having never paid the State for it.</p>
                        <p>The taking away of Croſſes, and Superſtition, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them down, I thank God for; but withal, I would not that the State ſhould ſell Gold at two pence the pound weight to any perſon, upon what pretence of ſervice or well-deſerving ſoëver; for after that rate the Parlament may have ſervants too many for their profit, and in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging buſineſs in this manner, the whole Common-wealth ſuffer's, and ſom private perſons get mightie Eſtates, to the great damage of the Common-wealth in general. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaie, what is the Common-wealth's, ought to bee ſold at the beſt advantage and improvement for the publick, and and not for private reſpects, ſold at an under value, upon any pretence to any private perſon whatſoëver. I know for ſpeaking this truth. I ſhall have envie, but my comfort is, it will bee by or from none but intereſted parties; and all thoſe that are not, vvill thank mee for ſpeaking truth.</p>
                        <p>The Parlament heretofore made many Proviſional Acts, ſom onely to continue to the next Seſsions of Parlament, which was ſomtimes three, five, ſeven, ten, fifteen years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Parlament vvas called, and no remedie could bee had out of Parlament, if that theſe Acts were found prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the State till the next Seſsions of Parlament. Now by the bleſsing of God on this Nation, theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are remedied, for the Parlament ſit's alwaies; ſo that if the Parlament paſs any Act, vvhich they ſhall finde upon juſt grounds either to add to it, or take from it, they have it in their own power to alter it upon the trial, if a Law ſhould paſs vvhich vvere not for the general good of the Nation.</p>
                        <p>I beeing required to attend the Committee of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, about the Act now preſented to the Parlament, I did ſee, and vvas privie upon vvhat grave conſideration everie branch of the Act now depending before the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Committee, vvas framed and put down by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Council of State, before ever it vvas recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119441:87"/> to the Parlament. And I do humbly deſire for the ſervice of the Common-wealth, if any alteration bee made in the Act, thoſe that drew the draft of the Act, may bee required to attend the Committee to give their reaſons for the whole Act, or any part of it; for upon the effectual paſsing of this Act, much doth depend for the ſafetie of this Nation, and it is of an higher concernment to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then I can expreſs; and I humbly conceiv, there ought to bee no reſpect of private intereſt, where the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Nation is ſo highly concerned.</p>
                        <p>I humbly deſire the Honorable Committee, that the Certificate of the Officers of the Mint may bee taken into your ſerious conſiderations, there beeing verie few men in the Nation, can ſpeak ſo much upon their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe abuſes concerning the Treaſure of the Nation, as theſe Gentlemen, the Officers of the Mint have certified, which ever ſince their Certificate, hath been found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part to bee true.</p>
                        <p>The Mint ſtanding ſtill and neglected, the Treaſure that hath been Imported, was never brought into the Mint, but Exported out again; by which means for the private gain of a few men, the Nation is ruined and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Trade Inwards and Outwards, driven without paying of Cuſtom, and the Stock of Treaſure of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almoſt all Exported in theſe times, now there is ſo much occaſion for monie, to the admiration and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many lovers of the Common-wealth, that truly underſtand the ſecrets and myſteries of Trade,</p>
                        <p>And what miſchiefs theſe doings will in the end bring upon this Common-wealth, is deeply apprehended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe men, and can have no ſtop but by a vigorous Act to bring the Offendors to Exemplarie Juſtice, vvhoſe Fines and Compoſitions, throughout the Nation, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to many ſcores of thouſands of pounds to the States, for the paiment of publick debts, if Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of enquiries according to former preſidents bee grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119441:87"/> by Act of Parlament throughout the Nation, to enquire for the laſt ten years of theſe abuſes.</p>
                        <p>If in declaring what hath paſſed at the Committee, and of other Tranſactions, bee not uſual, I ſhall, and do humbly deſire to have my pardon; for if my ſilence might not have endangered the Common-wealth, this that I have ſaid, ſhould never have com to publick view; for I know how to keep ſecrets as well as ſom other men.</p>
                        <p>I have read of one that was born dumb, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for many years; ſeeing one coming to kill his Father, cried out, <hi>God ſave my Father,</hi> and ſo gave timely warning for his Father to prevent the danger. A happie ſpeaking of the Childe for the Father. Truly I count the Obligation to my Countrie, above the Obligation to my Father.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen this danger many years coming upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though I am but young, and ignorant in other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, I am ſure there are but few, if any in the Nation, that have had thoſe waies and means to finde out, and diſcover theſe miſchiefs, which I have. I know and apprehend more then I vvill or can expreſs.</p>
                        <p>The great miſchiefs Tranſporting Gold and Silver bring's on this Nation, I apprehend.</p>
                        <p>The condition of your Armie, which muſt bee burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, if they have not monie to paie for Quartering, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the danger and damage.</p>
                        <p>The neceſsitie of Tradeſ-men, and Handie-Crafts men will bee put to for want of emploiment, upon the ſcarcitie of monie, making all Trade to decaie, I apprehend.</p>
                        <p>The ſad condition of poor people, vvho will bee enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for vvant to part with their clothes, their bedding, their diſhes they eat their meat in, I apprehend.</p>
                        <p>The danger the want and povertie of the poor will bring upon this State, if there bee not waies found out to bring Monie into the Nation, I do verie ſadly and ſeriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the inconveniences.</p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:119441:88"/>
                        <p>And therefore I crie, <hi>God ſave the Common-wealth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God put it into the hearts of the Parlament, to ſee to keep that little monie wee have yet left; and to finde out and puniſh thoſe that have cheated, and robbed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of their Treaſure, and to ſtudie vvaies how to bring in monie into the Nation; for if this bee not don ſpeedily, in all probabilitie, greater inconveniences then I dare write, will com on the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>Much more I could ſaie, but if theſe Reaſons before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, nor the Certificates of the Officers of the Cuſtoms, and the Certificate of the Officers of the Mint, &amp; ſeveral reaſons of ſom Aldermen of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> for the ſtopping of the Tranſporting of Gold &amp; Silver, and the Citie of <hi>London's</hi> Petition to the Parlament, preſenting the great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences Tranſporting Treaſure hath brought upon this Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the Nation; I humbly ſaie, if all theſe will not prevail, I have don: For if I ſhould write a Volume as big as <hi>Speed's</hi> Chronicle, I cannot give more clear ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the neceſſitie of paſsing this Act.</p>
                        <p>If God hath decreed this Nation ſhall bee couſened of all it's Treaſure, and the Offendors not queſtioned, nor dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquirie made after it, and ſuch means as our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and other Nations (having far leſs occaſion for monie then wee have) do daily practiſe; to prevent theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and diſcover the Offendors, I ſhall with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſubmit to God's Providence, and reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>I have clearly diſcharged my dutie to my Countrie, in declaring this buſineſs to the Common-wealth, that ſo they may know the true reaſons of the ſcarcitie of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Nation, and the damage they ſuſtein by the want thereof, and how the Mint com's to bee obſtructed, that almoſt no Monie hath been Coined for theſe three laſt years.</p>
                        <p>For ſom men that have clamored at mee for firſt enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to diſcover the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119441:88"/> year 1635. in the late King's time, I ſhall deſire them to conſider, that I was firſt complained of by the Gold-ſmiths themſelvs, beeing at the Council-Table, 1634. for buying up of Light Gold, and Tranſporting of it into <hi>France,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Perin</hi> the Gold-ſmith in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> told mee the ſame daie that ſom Gold-ſmiths complained of mee at the Council-Table; I going then up to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to ſee what the Gold-ſmiths did, and upon their complaint, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted cloſe priſoner for twentie weeks; and yet for all that, death would have been more welcom to mee then to have diſcovered the Merchants at that time, and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Amies,</hi> Maſter <hi>Turner,</hi> and Maſter <hi>White,</hi> all of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and now living, know. But when I found the Merchants joined againſt mee, that were Tranſporters of Gold themſelvs, I was willing to make my peace, though it coſt mee dear, and not ſuffer longer for ungrateful men.</p>
                        <p>When I was engaged in the late King's ſervice, I was ever faithful to all his juſt Commands, and to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power did ſerv him in all lawful waies, and beyond that I would never go.</p>
                        <p>Now with all humilitie I have humbly tendred my ſelf to the Parlament, for I think &amp; believ, &amp; I ſpeak as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, I living under their protection, I am as much bound to ſerv them faithfully, as ever I did the late King; and I have this advantage in the change, Kings die, but the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now eſtabliſhed, never die's: ſo that here I humbly fix and proſtrate, laie my ſelf, and all my endeavors to the uttermoſt of my power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the intereſt and ſervice of the Parlament, as it is now eſtabliſhed, without King or Lords, againſt any perſon whomſoëver.</p>
                        <p>It may bee objected by ſom men, that I have not don pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in declaring ſo much for the ſervice of the State, as I have don, before I knew my conditions, what the State
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119441:89"/> would do for mee; for by theſe informations, I have given light enough to have others to go on, and laie the foundation of the Regulating of the Trade of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it may bee now don by others as well as by my ſelf. This in part I grant to bee true; but my cauſ, is not everie man's cauſ; I was blaſted by the devilliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſom men, and to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and the Parlament, preſented as a Malignant, a Papiſt, one diſ-affected to the Parlament and preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it now eſtabliſhed, without King, or Houſ of Lords: So that beeing under this cloud, and hard opinion of the State, and ſuffering ſo long time in the Tower, as before J have ſaid, and my Eſtate ſtill under Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, it did highly concern mee to take any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to remove this hard opinion off mee, and that the Parlament might ſee from the bottom of my heart my ſeal in deeds, and not in words, to do them ſervice.</p>
                        <p>J have with all humilitie-truly and plainly ſtated this buſineſs, and J hope have laid the ground-work for the ſetting of other more learned heads on work, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting what I have roughly begun; and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will receiv a great advantage by it: and if the Parlament ſhall pleaſ to command mee to ſerv them in any of theſe particulars, they ſhall not finde many men will do them ſervice on the terms I ſhall, and do with all humilitie offer them; for I will willingly, ſo I may have my Eſtate, &amp; Offices reſtored again to mee, or their value, which have been taken from mee, upon miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſom malitious people, give the maimed ſoldiers that have fought in the Parlament's ſervice ſince the death of the late King, one half of my Eſtate I ſhall die poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of; and to the maimed Sea-men, that are emploied in the State's ſervice, ſince the death of the late King, one quarter-part of my Eſtate, which I ſhall die poſſeſſed of; and the other quarter-part, I will, and do reſerv to give to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119441:89"/> ſom friends; ſo that three parts of four of what I have, or ſhall have, com's to thoſe that have, or ſhall have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their lives in the State's ſervice; and I am, and ſhall bee no more but a faithful Steward to improve my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to their advantage. And for the true performance of this, I will willingly give a perfect Accompt to the Maſter's of Trinitie-Houſ, and of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in <hi>Southwark</hi> once everie year, and give them a perfect Invoies of my Eſtate, and where it remain's, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie not to paſs any of it away, other then for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for my maintenance; and to have the diſpoſing of one intire quarter-part to ſom kindred or friends of mine, at my death; the other three parts to bee freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the relief of maimed ſoldiers and ſea-men, that have or ſhall bee emploied in the Parlament's ſervice, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded J may be reſtored to my Eſtate.</p>
                        <p>And this J do not as J am conſcientious of any evil wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly or willingly, I ever acted againſt the State (for J ſtand upon my innocence) but J do it really, that it may bee a pattern to ſom that have blaſted mee to the State as a Malignant, and a Delinquent, they having no children, and have got ſom ſcores of thouſands of pounds by the Parlament's ſervice; that they in humble thankfulneſs to God for his mercie, would beſtow a good part on the poor, and for the future bee aſhamed of ſcandalizing mee, when the reality of my words and deeds diſprove them to the whole world; for Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants make not ſuch free will-offerings to the poor maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoldiers, and maimed ſea-men, that have, and ſhall loſe their limbs in the defence of their Countrie and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as it is now ſettled, without King, or Lords: and though it may not bee above a mite in compariſon to the State, J cannot poſsibly expreſs my real intentions in the Parlament's ſervice, more then by theſe my words and deeds. And J will upon the peril of my life, bring the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119441:90"/> Parlament in fiftie thouſand pounds by the Fines and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver, and ſuch as have practiſed many abuſes on the Coins and Bullion of the Nation, within the compaſs of one year, beſides what ſummes hereafter, if Commiſsions according to former preſidents bee granted, and if the Parlament pleaſ to paſs the Act as it is now drawn, againſt Tranſporters of Gold; which Act was recommended by the Council of State to the Parlament, and hath been twice read in the Parlament Houſ, and committed; and when it paſſe's the Houſ, the Mint in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> will again flouriſh, a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the greateſt honor, profit, and ſafetie to the Nation in general, that can bee, as your affairs now ſtand.</p>
                        <p>What is here ſaid, is with all humilitie preſented to the Parlament for the ſervice of the Common-wealth, by a faithful lover of his Countrie; beeing deſired to ſtate my Reaſons by ſom in Autoritie for paſsing the aforeſaid Act, I humbly conceiv (if it were made ſtricter then it is) it were far better for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: For Tranſporting Treaſure heretofore hath been made Felonie, when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, I humbly conceiv, had not ſo much occaſion to ſee to keep their Treaſure in the Nation, and the Mint going, as now they have.</p>
